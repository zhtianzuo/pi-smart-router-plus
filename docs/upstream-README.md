# pi-smart-router

**Auto-model router middleware for the [pi](https://pi.dev) coding agent.**

> **v1.0 — SemVer stable (honest defaults).** From the `1.0.0` release on, the public API and documented operator surface follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org): breaking changes land only in a new major version, each accompanied by a migration guide — start with [docs/migration-v1.md](docs/migration-v1.md). **1.0 means stable API + honest calibration floors + gates that catch Sept-class failures** — not a claim that cheap-tier routing is behaviorally proven. [#95](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/95) / [#110](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/110) remain open for verifier-graded recalibration. The published release always mirrors `package.json` ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-smart-router)).

pi-smart-router intercepts every LLM inference request and dynamically routes it to the optimal execution engine — balancing cost, capability, latency, and time-to-first-token (TTFT) — without requiring you to manually pick a model for each turn.

| pi-smart-router is | pi-smart-router is not |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| A pi extension that auto-selects the best model per request | A replacement for pi or your LLM provider |
| A three-tier router: local, economical cloud, frontier cloud | A post-generation output judger (FrugalGPT-style) |
| Cache-aware with session pinning to preserve prompt-cache economics | A turn-by-turn model switcher that shatters provider caching |
| Registry-driven in pi (no YAML copy for normal use) | An RL-trained router requiring agent trace datasets |

## How it works

```text
request → hardware probe → loop escalation → turn envelope → context-fit gate
        → low-intensity tier gate → session pin → deterministic triage
        → local zero-tier → triage cloud fallback → HyDRA embedding matcher
        → safe cloud default → context overflow fallback
```

The pipeline runs **12 stages sequentially with early exit** — the moment any stage reaches a routing decision, subsequent stages are skipped. Every decision includes the stage name, reason code, candidates considered, estimated cost, and routing latency for full observability.

| Stage | Budget | What it does |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Hardware Probe | — | Checks platform/RAM/battery to gate local inference |
| Loop Escalation | — | Detects repeated identical tool failures; escalates session to frontier |
| Turn Envelope | <2ms | Classifies turn type: tool_result, planning, subagent, main_loop |
| Context-Fit Gate | — | Filters fleet to models whose context window fits estimated input tokens |
| Low-Intensity Gate | — | Structural tier hint, cluster match, and P(success) expected-cost scoring |
| Session Pin | <1ms | Returns pinned model if session has one; breaks pin on compaction or overflow |
| Deterministic Triage | <5ms | Aho-Corasick keyword scan + cyclomatic complexity analysis |
| Local Zero-Tier | <15ms | Pings LM Studio + Ollama in parallel; routes locally when eligible |
| Triage Cloud Fallback | <2ms | Trivial prompts not claimed locally route to the first healthy economical-cloud model |
| HyDRA Matcher | 80-120ms | ONNX embeddings, 3D requirement projection, shortfall gate, multi-objective scoring |
| Safe Cloud Default | — | First healthy economical-cloud model (context-fit aware) |
| Context Overflow Fallback | — | Escalates to largest-fit model when economical tiers cannot fit |

## Research lineage

pi-smart-router builds on ideas from several production and research routing systems:

- **Adopted:** [GitHub Copilot HyDRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08379) (shortfall matching decoupled from model identities), Zero-Tier local edge-cache pattern, [Weave Router](https://github.com/workweave/router) session pinning and multi-objective selection
- **Rejected:** FrugalGPT sequential cascading (tail latency), RouteLLM matrix factorization (confounder vulnerability), turn-by-turn dynamic routing (cache destruction)

See [docs/PRD.md](docs/PRD.md) for full architectural justification, [docs/deep-research.md](docs/deep-research.md) for the research survey, [docs/routing-roadmap.md](docs/routing-roadmap.md) for the prioritized quality backlog, [docs/gemini-research.md](docs/gemini-research.md) for the second-source agent-router report, and [docs/research/README.md](docs/research/README.md) for research provenance.

## Prerequisites

| Dependency | Required | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 22.19.0 | Yes | ES module package; matches `package.json` `engines.node` and CI (workflows pin Node `22.19.0`) |

> **Engine floor:** `package.json` declares `engines.node >= 22.19.0`. If you (or your environment) enable `engine-strict=true` in `.npmrc`, installs on Node < 22.19.0 fail with `EBADENGINE`; on a supported Node (>= 22.19.0), `npm ci` completes with no `EBADENGINE` warnings.
| [pi](https://pi.dev) coding agent | Yes | Extension host |
| macOS Apple Silicon | MVP | Primary supported platform |
| Linux (x64/arm64) | Experimental | Probe logic supported; not validated on real hardware |
| Windows (x64/arm64) | Experimental | Probe logic supported; not validated on real hardware |
| [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) or [Ollama](https://ollama.com) | Optional | Required for zero-tier local routing |
| Authenticated cloud providers in pi | Recommended | Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc. |

## Install

> **Security:** Pi packages run with full system access. Extensions execute arbitrary code. Review source before installing third-party packages ([pi packages docs](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/packages.md)).

### Via pi (recommended)

Install from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-smart-router) / [pi.dev/packages](https://pi.dev/packages):

```bash
pi install npm:pi-smart-router
pi --list-models | grep smart-router
```

Project-local install (writes to `.pi/settings.json`):

```bash
pi install -l npm:pi-smart-router
```

Then in pi:

```text
/model smart-router/auto
/smart-router status
```

**First run:** `pi install` runs `npm install` for package dependencies (`better-sqlite3` compiles natively). The first routed request downloads HyDRA ONNX weights to `.pi-smart-router/models/` under your state directory.

### Via npm (library API)

```bash
npm install pi-smart-router
```

Use `createRouter()` / `createRouterFromFleet()` for programmatic integration without the pi extension. That path is the **catalog / routing-core** composition root (not full extension wiring). See [Library vs extension](#library-vs-extension) and [Optional: YAML fleet (library API)](#optional-yaml-fleet-library-api).

### From source (contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router.git
cd pi-smart-router
npm install
```

The repo ships a **project-local pi extension** at `.pi/extensions/smart-router/`. pi auto-discovers it when you run `pi` from the repo root (after the project is trusted — see [Develop from clone](#develop-from-clone)).

## Quick start

After installing via `pi install npm:pi-smart-router` (or from clone — see below):

1. Authenticate providers (`/login`) and enable models in your scoped list if you use one (`/scoped-models`)
2. `/model smart-router/auto` — every turn runs through the routing pipeline
3. `/smart-router status`, `/smart-router history`, or `/smart-router stats` — inspect routing decisions and window aggregates

Set `SMART_ROUTER_LOG_ROUTING=1` before starting pi to print each routing decision to stderr (see [Environment variables](#environment-variables)).

## Use with pi

Detailed steps for the operator path above.

### Installed via npm

Global install (`pi install npm:pi-smart-router`) registers the extension from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`. No project `/trust` prompt is required for npm-installed extensions — start `pi` from any directory.

After auth or model list changes, restart pi or run `/reload`.

### Develop from clone

Requires **Pi ≥ 0.85.1** (`pi.minPiVersion`). The extension loads TypeScript from this repo via pi’s loader — no `npm run build` needed for dogfooding.

**Recommended (works from any cwd):** install the clone as a **path package** and remove any published npm copy. npm and path packages have different identities; leaving both installed can double-load and you may keep running a stale npm tarball.

```bash
# From anywhere — remove published package if present
pi remove npm:pi-smart-router

# Prefer an absolute path (relative paths are resolved from the install cwd first).
# Pi stores a path relative to ~/.pi/agent/ in settings (same pattern as other local packages).
pi install /path/to/pi-smart-router

# Pi does not run npm install for path packages
cd /path/to/pi-smart-router && npm install

pi list   # must show this clone path, not ~/.pi/agent/npm/.../pi-smart-router
pi --list-models | grep smart-router
```

**Alternative (repo-root discovery only):** with the npm package removed, start `pi` with cwd at this repo root. Project-local extensions under `.pi/extensions/` load only after the project is trusted — without trust, `smart-router` never appears in `/scoped-models` or `/model`.

**On first run**, pi prompts you to trust the project when it detects `.pi/extensions/`. Accept the prompt.

**Later or missed prompt:** run `/trust` inside pi to save a trust decision for this directory (or its parent) to `~/.pi/agent/trust.json`. Trust on a **parent folder** (for example `~/Documents/github`) applies to this repo as well. After `/trust`, **restart pi** — the current session is not reloaded automatically.

**Verify the extension loaded:**

```bash
pi --list-models | grep smart-router
```

You should see `smart-router  auto`. If the line is missing:

1. Confirm `pi list` points at this clone (path package) or that cwd is the repo root (discovery mode).
2. Confirm no `npm:pi-smart-router` entry remains in settings while developing from clone.
3. Confirm the project is trusted if relying on `.pi/extensions/` discovery (`/trust`, or check `~/.pi/agent/trust.json`).
4. Restart pi or run `/reload` after trusting or changing packages.

Non-interactive one-shot checks can pass `--approve` to trust project-local resources for that run only.

### Select the auto model

Switch to the smart-router provider (from any directory after npm install, or from repo root when developing from clone):

```text
/model smart-router/auto
```

If you use **scoped models** (`/scoped-models` or `enabledModels` in settings), enable `smart-router/auto` there first — when a scoped list is active, `/model` only resolves models in that list.

This registers `smart-router` as a custom provider with a single `auto` model. Every inference request runs through the routing pipeline and delegates to the selected underlying provider's streaming API.

#### `cursor/auto` vs `smart-router/auto`

pi exposes two different **auto** models. They are easy to confuse but play different roles:

| Model | Provider | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| `smart-router/auto` | `smart-router` (this extension) | Runs the routing pipeline on every turn and **delegates** to whichever underlying model HyDRA selects |
| `cursor/auto` | `cursor` (pi registry) | Cursor's opaque auto model — **direct** inference target when selected; Cursor picks the backend model |

**Recommended dogfood setup:** use `/model smart-router/auto` so routing, pinning, and telemetry stay active. Enable `cursor/auto` (and other Cursor models such as `composer-latest`) in your scoped fleet so the router can select them when appropriate — for example on planning turns or when the [Gemini tool-history guard](#gemini-thought_signature-400-errors) excludes unrepairable Google replay state.

**When to pin `/model cursor/auto` directly (bypass the router):**

- You want Cursor's opaque auto selection on every turn with no routing overhead
- You are debugging Cursor SDK auth or delegation outside the router
- You need a stable, non-routed session for comparison with routed behavior

**When to use `smart-router/auto`:**

- You want cost/capability-aware model selection across your full authenticated fleet
- You rely on session pinning, failover, or `/smart-router status` / `history` / `stats` telemetry
- Tool-heavy sessions with Gemini economical models work via in-repo replay repair (cross-provider included); the tool-history guard reroutes to non-Google models such as `cursor/auto` for unrepairable replay state (see [pi-smart-router#85](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/85), [pi-smart-router#158](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/158))

Cursor models (`cursor/*`, `composer-*`, and the opaque fleet id `default`) map to **frontier-cloud** tier in `pi-model-mapper.ts` so HyDRA can score them against Gemini and Claude instead of treating them as unknown economical models ([pi-smart-router#40](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/40), [pi-smart-router#70](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/70)). Related: [pi-smart-router#23](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/23) (turn envelope / pin order), [pi-smart-router#37](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/37) (Gemini `thought_signature` errors).

#### Cursor subscription quota vs API cost

Cursor models bill against your **Cursor Pro subscription quota**, not per-token API rates. The mapper sets `fallback_cost_per_1m: 0` (no API billing) and a separate **`quota_cost_per_1m`** virtual rate used only for frugality scoring and telemetry ([SP-096](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/70)). Economical API models (e.g. `gemini-flash-lite`) can outscore `composer-latest` on routine `main_loop` turns when capabilities are sufficient.

**Quota-sensitive fleet hygiene:** if you are near Cursor usage limits, **exclude `composer-latest`** (and other heavy Cursor frontier models) from your pi scoped fleet enable-list. Leave economical API models enabled so turn envelope and HyDRA prefer paid API tiers over subscription quota. The opaque id `default` is mapped to frontier tier — do not rely on it as an economical fallback.

### Operator commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/smart-router` | Same as `status` (default when no subcommand is given) |
| `/smart-router status` | Show fleet mode, fleet size, pricing freshness/staleness, and the last routing decision (stage, tier, selected model, latency) |
| `/smart-router history` | Show recent routing telemetry from SQLite (default limit; optional numeric limit, e.g. `/smart-router history 20`). Displays the concrete delegated model id (never bare virtual `auto`) |
| `/smart-router stats` | Privacy-safe session/window aggregates from routing telemetry: count, mean cost/latency with `cost_basis` labeling (actual vs estimated, SP-241), planning_delegate vs direct share, local vs cloud when distinguishable, and role cost breakdown. Optional vs-always-frontier savings when frontier fleet prices exist (omitted otherwise). The JSON snapshot (`buildStatsSnapshot`, automation surface) additionally carries warm rolling `cost_calibration` actual/estimate buckets (SP-242). Optional numeric limit, e.g. `/smart-router stats 50` |
| `/smart-router mode scoped` | Route only among pi's **enabled model patterns** (default) |
| `/smart-router mode all` | Route among **all authenticated models** in the registry |
| `/smart-router pricing refresh` | Manually fetch LiteLLM pricing from `LITELLM_PRICING_URL`, persist to SQLite, and rebuild the fleet with updated rates |
| `/smart-router export dataset [--limit N]` | Export opt-in routing dataset as JSONL (requires `SMART_ROUTER_DATASET=1`) |
| `/smart-router export telemetry-contrib [--limit N] [--embeddings]` | Export privacy-safe community telemetry JSON for calibration contributions (`--embeddings` opts in to captured 384-dim embedding rows) |
| `/smart-router feedback good\|bad` | Label the last auto-routed request outcome (requires `SMART_ROUTER_DATASET=1`) |
| `/smart-router unpin` | Clear the current session pin (in-memory and SQLite) so the next request runs the full routing pipeline |
| `/smart-router plan [--json]` | **Read-only** local placement report: encoder resident status, local model warm/cold, RAM/disk constraints, cold vs warm TPS, and bottleneck guess. `--json` prints the schema-stable report for automation |
| `/smart-router doctor` | **Read-only** local readiness checklist (✓/✗) with bottleneck guess and recommendation — validate placement without starting a route |

Fleet mode persists in the session. Use `scoped` to respect your `/model` enable-list; use `all` when you want the router to consider every provider you have logged into.

### Local placement plan / doctor (read-only, #116)

`/smart-router plan` and `/smart-router doctor` report **local placement readiness without mutating anything** — no route, pin, or gate is touched. Inspired by Colibrì's `coli plan` / `coli doctor`.

The report covers:

- **Encoder** — whether HyDRA ONNX artifacts are resident in the cache (`.pi-smart-router/models/`) or will download on first route
- **Local model warm/cold** — LM Studio / Ollama reachability and whether a model is actually loaded (`warm`) vs reachable-but-unloaded (`cold-start expected`)
- **Hardware** — platform/arch, total/free RAM, hardware-probe verdict (`full_local` / `classification_only` / `disabled`), battery state
- **Disk** — free GiB; flagged constrained below 2 GiB
- **Throughput (cold vs warm TPS)** — see formula below
- **Bottleneck guess** — one of `none`, `unsupported-platform`, `battery`, `memory`, `disk`, `no-local-runtime`, `cold-start`, `cold-throughput`, `warm-throughput`, with a rationale string
- **Recommendation** — `local-ready`, `local-warmup-needed`, or `local-unavailable`

`/smart-router plan --json` prints the same report as schema-stable JSON (`schemaVersion: 1`, `kind: "smart-router-placement-plan"`; all keys always present, unknowns are `null`) for automation.

**Cold vs warm TPS formula.** Throughput samples are tagged by phase: `warm` samples measure steady-state generation after model load; `cold` samples include cold-start load cost and never count toward viability. `warmMedianTps = median(tps where phase='warm')`; viability is `warmSamples > 0 AND warmMedianTps >= threshold` (default 25 tok/s). **Cold-only windows fail closed**: when only cold samples exist, local viability is false by policy (`requireWarmSamples: true`) — cold-start cost must not masquerade as steady-state throughput.

**Quality-preserving resource policy.** Under RAM/disk/battery pressure the router prefers **"local unavailable / escalate safely"** to a cloud default over silently weakening encoder fidelity (no quantization flips, no cheaper cascades, no FrugalGPT-style downgrade chains). `plan`/`doctor` surface this policy verbatim in the report's `policy` block.

After typing `/smart-router ` (with a trailing space), press **TAB** to see subcommands. Continue TAB-completing after `mode` or `pricing` for sub-options (`scoped`/`all`, `refresh`).

### 5. Verify

```bash
npm run verify:ci
```

## Concurrency contract

`RouterPipeline.route()` calls on a single router instance are **single-flight**: concurrent calls are serialized internally (SP-230, [#141](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/141)). Each exclusive route owns one per-route `RoutingContext`; overlapping executions are queued rather than interleaved — each queued call waits at most one routing latency. This applies to `createRouter()` / `createRouterFromFleet()` handles: a shared `router.dispatch` is safe to call concurrently, and serialization does not change routing policy outcomes. For parallel routing throughput, create separate router instances.

## Library vs extension

pi-smart-router ships in two shapes, and they are **not** feature-identical ([#153](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/153)):

| Path | What you get |
|------|--------------|
| **Pi extension** (`pi install npm:pi-smart-router`, or project-local `.pi/extensions/smart-router/` when developing from clone) — **supported product composition root** | The full product — the routing pipeline **plus** the stream-level behaviors below, with hardware probe + store-backed telemetry wired via `createDispatchOptions()` in `.pi/extensions/smart-router/fleet-bootstrap.ts` |
| **npm library** (`createRouter()` / `createRouterFromFleet()` / `GatewayDispatch`) — **catalog / embedder composition root** | The routing core — the 12-stage pipeline, fleet mapping, gateway health/failover *selection*, and constructor defaults for **`costEstimator` + `localRuntime` only**. Hardware probe stays disabled and telemetry is opt-in unless you pass those ports. Stream-level behaviors are stubbed or left to your embedder loop |

### Extension-only capabilities

These behaviors run in `.pi/extensions/smart-router/` and have **no equivalent in the library API**:

| Capability | Extension implementation | Library status |
|------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Planning delegate spawn** — cache-preserving ephemeral frontier sub-call on planning turns, with observation injection and bounded timeouts (SP-144, SP-213 / [#71](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/71), [#120](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/120)) | `.pi/extensions/smart-router/planning-delegate.ts` — compressed-context sub-call via `streamSimple`; falls back to direct frontier with a documented `fallback_reason` | The pipeline still emits `planning_delegate` decisions with delegate model and compressed limits, but **nothing spawns the delegate** — an embedder must implement the sub-call itself or accept direct-frontier routing |
| **Stream failover loop** — live provider-error failover across candidate models with user-facing notices (atomic state machine, [#33](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/33)) | `.pi/extensions/smart-router/route-and-delegate.ts` (~L377–595) — retries stream delegation across alternates, emits failover notices, ends in SP-226 fail-open safe default | `GatewayDispatch.selectFailover()` only **selects** an alternate model; no stream retry loop runs. The embedder owns iterating over failures and re-dispatching |
| **Output headroom escalation** — exclude failover candidates whose context window cannot fit input plus the required output floor (SP-108) | `route-and-delegate.ts` + `.pi/extensions/smart-router/delegation-runtime.ts` — per-attempt `computeOutputHeadroom` checks; `headroomExcludedModelIds` accumulate across the failover loop | `src/domain/delegation/output-headroom.ts` ships the helper, but **no library caller wires it** into `GatewayDispatch.dispatch()` — the embedder must apply it per attempt |
| **Cursor quota handling** — subscription-quota exhaustion detection and failover to `cursor/auto` or economical API models with `cursor_quota_exhausted` telemetry (SP-097 / [#70](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/70)) | The extension stream loop catches quota errors from live streams and drives `selectFailover` reactively | Detection and failover *selection* exist in `src/infrastructure/gateway/gateway-dispatch.ts` (`isCursorQuotaExhaustedError`, per-model quota tracking), but the **reactive trigger lives in the extension's stream loop** — library dispatch alone does not observe provider stream errors |

### The middleware is a lifecycle stub, not a router

`createPiRouterMiddleware()` / `RouterHandle.register()` (`src/api/middleware/pi-router-middleware.ts`) registers **lifecycle hooks only** — compaction flags and `model_select` overrides consumed when building the next routing request. It does **not** intercept LLM streams, route requests, or delegate inference. The production stream path lives in the pi extension (`route-and-delegate.ts`, `stream-delegation.ts`, `delegate-stream.ts`), not in the npm-exported middleware. Treat `middleware` as a flag registrar; routing happens through your call to `router.dispatch.dispatch()` or the extension's stream path.

### Recommended integration path

- **pi users:** install the **extension** (`pi install npm:pi-smart-router`). It is the supported composition root — everything in the table above works out of the box, including failover, delegate spawn, headroom escalation, quota reaction, hardware probe, and store-backed routing telemetry.
- **npm embedders:** you get the **routing core** (12-stage pipeline, fleet mapping, gateway health tracking, failover *selection*). Bare `createRouter()` does **not** wire hardware probe or telemetry by default — pass `GatewayDispatchOptions` on `createRouterFromFleet(fleet, options)` when you need those ports. Plan to implement your own stream delegation, failover iteration, headroom checks, and planning-delegate spawn around the decisions the pipeline returns — or track [#149](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/149) (**extension public facade**), the migration plan for exposing the extension's stream/delegation surface as supported library API so this gap closes over time. Until #149 lands, the extension modules also import `src/**` internals directly, so deep imports into `src/` are not a stable API. See [docs/extension-package-boundary.md](docs/extension-package-boundary.md) for the facade vs internal-API boundary, the deep-import lint guard, and the extension coverage gate. See also [Composition roots in the 1.0 migration guide](docs/migration-v1.md#composition-roots-library-createrouter-vs-pi-extension).

```text
pi extension path (full product)        npm library path (routing core)
────────────────────────────────        ───────────────────────────────
pi (host agent)                         your host application
  └─ .pi/extensions/smart-router/         └─ createRouter() / createRouterFromFleet()
       ├─ routing pipeline (src/)  ════════    ├─ routing pipeline (src/)        ← shared core
       ├─ stream failover loop          ✗      ├─ GatewayDispatch: health tracking,
       ├─ planning delegate spawn       ✗      │   failover selection only
       ├─ output headroom escalation    ✗      ├─ lifecycle middleware (stub: hooks only)
       └─ cursor quota failover         ✗      └─ embedder implements: stream loop,
                                            delegate spawn, headroom checks, quota reaction
```

`✗` = capability exists only on the extension path today; [#149](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/149) is the plan to close the gap.

## Fleet behavior

When you use `smart-router/auto`, the extension does **not** read `config/models.yaml`. Instead:

1. **Discover** — `modelRegistry.getAvailable()` returns authenticated models from pi.
2. **Scope** — In `scoped` mode, filter to patterns from pi settings (`getEnabledModels()`). In `all` mode, use the full registry.
3. **Map** — `src/config/pi-model-mapper.ts` maps each pi model to a `ModelProfile` (tier, capabilities, pricing) using provider and model-id patterns.
4. **Route** — `createRouterFromFleet()` runs the 12-stage pipeline on each request.
5. **Delegate** — The extension resolves the chosen model in the registry and forwards the stream via pi-ai's built-in provider APIs.

Unknown models receive conservative economical-cloud defaults. Local providers (`lmstudio`, `ollama`) map to `zero-tier`. Cursor provider models (`cursor/*`, `composer-*`, opaque id `default`) map to `frontier-cloud` with explicit capability defaults (SP-086, SP-098). Benchmark-grounded capability vectors (including multi-fleet `github-copilot/*`, Gemini, and Anthropic dogfood IDs, aliased family-by-family) are documented in the [capability profile coverage report](docs/capability-profile-coverage.md) ([#108](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/108) / [#124](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/124)).

To refresh after auth or settings changes, restart pi or `/reload` extensions.

## Optional: YAML fleet (library API)

For programmatic integration **without** the pi extension, load a static fleet catalog from YAML and route via `GatewayDispatch.dispatch()`.

This path is **catalog-oriented**: `createRouter()` loads `models.yaml` and constructs `GatewayDispatch` with library defaults (`costEstimator` + `localRuntime`). It does **not** call the extension's `createDispatchOptions()` — so hardware probe remains disabled and no store-backed `telemetryEmitter` is attached unless you pass those options yourself. Prefer the [pi extension](#library-vs-extension) when you want the full product composition root.

```bash
cp config/models.yaml.example ./config/models.yaml
# Edit config/models.yaml — at least one model per tier
```

```typescript
import { createRouter, createRouterFromFleet } from 'pi-smart-router';

const router = createRouter({ modelsPath: './config/models.yaml' });
router.register(piExtensionHooks); // lifecycle only: compaction + model override

const decision = await router.dispatch.dispatch(routingRequest);
// Embedder forwards inference to decision.selected_model_id

// Optional: wire probe/telemetry yourself (same options bag as GatewayDispatch)
// createRouterFromFleet(fleet, { systemInfoProvider, hardwareConfig, telemetryEmitter, ... })
```

### Embedder integration paths

| Path | When to use | Routing | Lifecycle hooks |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Pi extension** (recommended) | Running inside pi | `pi install npm:pi-smart-router` (or project-local `.pi/extensions/smart-router/` when developing from clone) registers `smart-router/auto` and delegates streams | Extension calls `router.register()`; compaction/model overrides wired automatically |
| **Library API** | Custom host, tests, or non-pi embedders | Your code calls `router.dispatch.dispatch()` (or wraps the pipeline) | Call `router.register(hooks)` to wire compaction and `model_select` events |

The library `createPiRouterMiddleware()` / `RouterHandle.register()` registers **lifecycle hooks only** — not routing, context capture, or `before_provider_request`. Do not expect `middleware` to intercept LLM streams; that is the extension's `streamSimple` path or your embedder's dispatch loop.

`createRouter()` returns a `RouterHandle`:

| Property | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `middleware` | `PiRouterMiddleware` | Lifecycle hook registrar (`register`, `lifecycleHookState`) |
| `dispatch` | `GatewayDispatch` | Gateway with circuit breaker, failover, rate limiting |
| `fleet` | `readonly ModelProfile[]` | Loaded fleet catalog |
| `register` | `(hooks) => void` | Alias for `middleware.register` — attach pi lifecycle hooks |

You can also pass a pre-built fleet:

```typescript
import { createRouterFromFleet } from 'pi-smart-router';

const router = createRouterFromFleet(myFleetProfiles);
```

Example fleet entry:

```yaml
models:
  - id: local-gemma-4-7b
    tier: zero-tier
    provider: lmstudio
    endpoint: http://localhost:1234/v1
    capabilities:
      reasoning: 0.3
      code_gen: 0.6
      tool_use: 0.1
    pricing:
      registry_key: local/free
      fallback_cost_per_1m: 0.0

  - id: claude-3.5-haiku
    tier: economical-cloud
    provider: anthropic
    # ...

  - id: claude-3.5-sonnet
    tier: frontier-cloud
    provider: anthropic
    # ...
```

Tiers: `zero-tier`, `economical-cloud`, `frontier-cloud`. See [config/models.yaml.example](config/models.yaml.example).

### Routing cluster catalog (library API)

Reference prompts grouped by tier bias for semantic cluster matching (SP-099). Operators tune clusters in YAML without code changes. Precomputed centroids live in `config/routing-centroids.json` (SP-114); when that file is absent, centroids are computed at load time as the mean embedding of each cluster's reference prompts.

```bash
cp config/routing-clusters.yaml.example ./config/routing-clusters.yaml
cp config/routing-centroids.json.example ./config/routing-centroids.json
# Edit reference_prompts, min_similarity, and min_margin per cluster
# Regenerate centroids after catalog changes:
npm run routing:bootstrap-centroids
```

The bootstrap script embeds each reference prompt via the HyDRA MiniLM ONNX pipeline (384-dim), mean-pools to centroid vectors, and writes `config/routing-centroids.json` with `{ cluster_id, tier_bias, centroid, reference_count }` per cluster. ONNX artifacts cache under `.pi-smart-router/models/` on first run.

```typescript
import { loadRoutingClusters } from 'pi-smart-router';

const catalog = await loadRoutingClusters({
  filePath: './config/routing-clusters.yaml',
  embedder: myTextEmbedder, // shared ONNX embedder (SP-100)
});
// Reason codes: cluster_${id} — e.g. cluster_low_stakes_general

// createClusterMatcher (cluster-matcher module) prefers routing-centroids.json when present.
```

Cluster IDs are stable reason-code prefixes (`cluster_low_stakes_general`, `cluster_architecture`, etc.). See [config/routing-clusters.yaml.example](config/routing-clusters.yaml.example).

## Configuration

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `ROUTER_STATE_DB_PATH` | `./.pi-smart-router/state.db` | Override SQLite state store location (telemetry, pricing catalog, session data) |
| `SMART_ROUTER_LOG_ROUTING` | (unset) | Set to `1` to log each routing decision to stderr as JSON (debugging dogfood sessions). Canonical payload builder (`buildRoutingDecisionLogPayload`) includes top-level `stage`, `reason_code`, `low_intensity_score`, `tier_hint`, `local_eligible_reason`, and `cluster_id` (plus nested `cluster_summary` / `features`). The pi extension’s live stderr logger is still a slim subset — see [LOG_ROUTING field checklist](#log_routing-field-checklist) |
| `SMART_ROUTER_DATASET` | (unset) | Set to `1` to opt in to privacy-safe routing dataset capture (metadata and feature fields only; 30-day / 10k-row retention). Prompt text, messages, and tool arguments are never stored. Required for outcome labels and P(success) training export. See [#8](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/8). |
| `SMART_ROUTER_DATASET_FINGERPRINT` | (unset) | Set to `1` (requires `SMART_ROUTER_DATASET=1`) to store an install-local HMAC-SHA256 fingerprint of each normalized prompt for duplicate detection within this install. The install pepper lives in `.pi-smart-router/.dataset-key` (gitignored) and is never exported. **Warning:** short or common prompts are vulnerable to offline rainbow-table guessing; use only when you accept that tradeoff. See [#10](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/10). |
| `SMART_ROUTER_DATASET_EMBEDDINGS` | (unset) | Set to `1` (requires `SMART_ROUTER_DATASET=1`) to capture the raw 384-dim HyDRA encoder embedding on each dataset row (derived dense vector of the metadata-prefixed routing input — never prompt text). Embeddings stay local until you additionally export with `--embeddings`; they exist so the hydra_projection ≥100-row training floor can ever be met. See [#170](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/170). |
| `MODELS_YAML_PATH` | `./config/models.yaml` | Fleet catalog path (library API only) |
| `SMART_ROUTER_PLANNING_TURN_BUFFER` | `2` | SAAR planning buffer: frontier planning turns allowed before hard-lock ([v0.2.0 Continuity](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/72)) |
| `SMART_ROUTER_PLANNING_DELEGATE_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable cache-preserving planning delegate ([#71](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/71)) |
| `SMART_ROUTER_PLANNING_DELEGATE_MAX_MESSAGES` | `12` | Compressed-context message cap for frontier sub-call |
| `SMART_ROUTER_PLANNING_DELEGATE_MAX_TOKENS` | `16384` | Compressed-context token cap for frontier sub-call |
| `SMART_ROUTER_PLANNING_DELEGATE_EXCLUDE_EXECUTION_HISTORY` | `true` | Exclude tool execution history from delegate payload |
| `SMART_ROUTER_PLANNING_DELEGATE_GLOBAL_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120000` | Global cap (ms) on the whole planning-delegate stage per planning turn — bounds fan-out wall-clock so a stalled worker cannot hang TTFT ([#120](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/120)) |
| `SMART_ROUTER_PLANNING_DELEGATE_SUB_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | Per-call cap (ms) on each delegate sub-call worker; on expiry the worker is cancelled/abandoned and routing falls back to direct frontier with `planning_delegate_timeout` ([#120](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/120)) |
| `SMART_ROUTER_ADAPTIVE_REASONING_ENABLED` | `true` | Master switch for the adaptive thinking-level policy ([#166](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/166)); `false` passes the session thinking level through unchanged |
| `SMART_ROUTER_ADAPTIVE_REASONING_MIN_LEVEL` | (unset) | Floor on policy-derived thinking levels (`minimal\|low\|medium\|high\|xhigh\|max`) — see [Adaptive reasoning](#adaptive-reasoning-thinking-level-166) |
| `SMART_ROUTER_ADAPTIVE_REASONING_MAX_LEVEL` | (unset) | Ceiling on policy-derived thinking levels (incl. turn-class upgrades) — see [Adaptive reasoning](#adaptive-reasoning-thinking-level-166) |
| `SMART_ROUTER_PREFIX_CACHE_WEIGHT` | `0.20` | SAAR weight on warm prefix value in cache breakeven math (0–1; [#73](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/73)) |
| `SMART_ROUTER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `300` | SAAR idle seconds before pin reopens for full re-route |
| `SMART_ROUTER_SWITCH_THRESHOLD` | `0.5` | SAAR switch score gate (0–1) for tier upgrades during hard-lock |
| `ROUTER_SAFE_DEFAULT_TIER` | `economical-cloud` | Fallback tier on any routing failure |
| `LITELLM_PRICING_URL` | — | LiteLLM pricing JSON source |

### LOG_ROUTING field checklist

When `SMART_ROUTER_LOG_ROUTING=1`, prefer the canonical payload from `buildRoutingDecisionLogPayload` (library / tests). Checklist for [#99](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/99):

| Field | In payload builder? | Notes |
|-------|---------------------|-------|
| `stage` | Yes (top-level) | Pipeline stage that decided |
| `reason_code` | Yes (top-level) | Machine-readable reason |
| `low_intensity_score` | Yes (top-level + `cluster_summary`) | Null when low-intensity stage did not run |
| `tier_hint` | Yes (top-level + `cluster_summary`) | Null when no tier hint |
| `local_eligible_reason` | Yes (top-level + `features`) | Null when local_zero did not evaluate eligibility |
| `cluster_id` | Yes (top-level + `cluster_summary`) | Null when no cluster match |
| `pricing_window` | Yes (top-level + `peak_pricing_summary`) | Peak vs off-peak rationale for the selected model (SP-244 / #165); the extension stderr logger carries `pricing_window` + `peak_pricing` |

**Gap:** the pi extension’s live stderr path (`logRoutingDecision` in `.pi/extensions/smart-router`) still emits a slim JSON object (`selected_model_id`, `stage`, `reason_code`, `features`, `delegate`) and does **not** yet call `buildRoutingDecisionLogPayload`. SQLite `/smart-router history` and the payload builder carry the full checklist; wire the extension logger in a follow-up if dogfood needs identical stderr shape.

**History model id:** `/smart-router history` resolves bare/`smart-router` virtual `auto` to the concrete planning-delegate primary (or qualifies Cursor opaque `auto` as `cursor/auto`) so operators see the delegated fleet model, not the virtual router id.

### SAAR session pin and cache breakeven (v0.2.0 Continuity)

v0.2.0 adds **Session-Aware Agentic Routing (SAAR)** pin knobs ([#72](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/72)) and a **cache breakeven gate** ([#73](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/73)) that blocks tier switches when `marginal_savings + future_cache_value <= cache_reprime_cost` — preventing cheap-turn savings from invalidating a warm prefix cache.

| Knob | Env var | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| Planning buffer | `SMART_ROUTER_PLANNING_TURN_BUFFER` | `2` | First N turns may route planning to frontier while pin metadata stays economical |
| Prefix cache weight | `SMART_ROUTER_PREFIX_CACHE_WEIGHT` | `0.20` | Discounted future cache credit in breakeven |
| Idle reopen | `SMART_ROUTER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `300` | Seconds of inactivity before SAAR resets and pin reopens |
| Hard-lock upgrade gate | `SMART_ROUTER_SWITCH_THRESHOLD` | `0.5` | Score threshold for tier upgrades after buffer exhaust |

**Dogfood verification (multi-turn planning session)**

1. Start pi with routing logs: `SMART_ROUTER_LOG_ROUTING=1 pi` (optional: tune SAAR env vars above).
2. Run `/model smart-router/auto` and begin a multi-turn planning session (planning turns mixed with tool results).
3. Inspect stderr JSON lines — confirm `saar_summary.buffer_active` / `saar_reason_code: saar_buffer_active` on early planning turns, then `hard_lock: true` / `saar_hard_lock` after the buffer exhausts.
4. On a warm pinned session, trigger a `tool_result` sub-route — when breakeven fails, expect `breakeven_summary.decision: "blocked"` and `breakeven_reason_code: breakeven_blocked` while the pin holds.
5. Use `pi router explain` (or `POST /v1/route/explain`) on the same session — `features.breakeven` and `features.saar` mirror telemetry fields for operator audit.

See [routing-roadmap.md](docs/routing-roadmap.md) §2 P0 for design context.

**Long-running pi sessions — in-memory state eviction (v0.21.0, [#145](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/145)).** Session pins and in-memory routing snapshots live in process memory, not in the SQLite telemetry store. When pi ends a session, the extension's `session_shutdown` handler (reason: `quit` / `reload` / `new` / `resume` / `fork`) calls `evictInMemorySessionState` (`src/api/session-eviction.ts`) and drops **all** in-memory routing state for that session — pins, cache-breakeven snapshots, turn metadata. A new session starts cold: no stale pin, no warm-cache assumption carries over. Persistent telemetry in `.pi-smart-router/state.db` is untouched. As a safety net for orphaned sessions (e.g. a crashed pi process that never emitted `session_shutdown`), a sweep on `session_start` evicts sessions idle longer than `ORPHAN_SESSION_TTL_MS` (**24 hours**, exported from `.pi/extensions/smart-router/session-lifecycle.ts`); the sweep fails open — a missing session id or sweep error never blocks session start.

### Planning delegate (v0.4.0 Delegate)

When a **planning** turn would route primary inference to frontier while a warm **economical** session pin is active, smart-router prefers **cache-preserving delegation** ([#71](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/71)):

1. **Pipeline** (`turn_envelope`) emits `planning_delegate` — primary stays on the pinned economical model; `features.planning_delegate` names the frontier **delegate** model and compressed-context limits.
2. **Pi extension** (`.pi/extensions/smart-router`) runs an ephemeral frontier sub-call with compressed context (tool execution history excluded by default), injects the result as an observation user message, then delegates **primary** streaming to the pinned economical model.
3. **Fallback** — when delegate is disabled, spawn fails, or the delegate model is missing from the registry, the extension falls back to a **direct frontier** route with a documented `fallback_reason` in explain/telemetry.

**Stream piping (SP-170):** Primary delegated inference **live-forwards** provider events to pi (`start` / `text_delta` / … as they arrive). The planning-delegate sub-call stays **buffered** — only the final observation text is injected into primary context; frontier tokens from the ephemeral sub-call are discarded and never reach the user-facing stream. On infra failover, a synthetic `text_delta` notice is pushed after the retry stream's `start` (no mutation of a buffered event array).

| Knob | Env var | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| Delegate enabled | `SMART_ROUTER_PLANNING_DELEGATE_ENABLED` | `true` | When `false`, SAAR buffer allows direct frontier planning (`planning_direct_frontier` + `planning_delegate_disabled`) |
| Compressed message cap | `SMART_ROUTER_PLANNING_DELEGATE_MAX_MESSAGES` | `12` | Max messages sent to the frontier sub-call |
| Compressed token cap | `SMART_ROUTER_PLANNING_DELEGATE_MAX_TOKENS` | `16384` | Token budget for compressed delegate context |
| Exclude tool history | `SMART_ROUTER_PLANNING_DELEGATE_EXCLUDE_EXECUTION_HISTORY` | `true` | Strip tool-call / tool-result turns from delegate payload |

**Coordination boundary with pi core:** smart-router owns **routing** (when to delegate, which models, compressed limits, fallback reason codes). **Sub-agent spawn and observation injection** run in the pi extension via `streamSimple` — pi core must expose a delegate/stream API the extension can call; smart-router does not orchestrate pi's outer sub-agent scheduler. Operators enabling `/model smart-router/auto` get delegate behavior automatically when the extension is loaded; no separate pi sub-agent config is required beyond a frontier model in the registry.

**Dogfood verification (planning delegate)**

1. Start pi with routing logs: `SMART_ROUTER_LOG_ROUTING=1 pi` and `/model smart-router/auto`.
2. Begin a session on an economical pin (routine prompts), then trigger planning turns (e.g. architecture or multi-step design work).
3. Inspect stderr JSON — on delegate turns expect `reason_code: planning_delegate`, `planning_delegate_summary.path: "delegate"`, `primary_model_id` equal to the pin, and `delegate_model_id` pointing at frontier.
4. Confirm primary inference stays on the economical model (cache-friendly) while stderr shows `[smart-router] planning delegate sub-call completed` with the frontier model id.
5. Disable delegate (`SMART_ROUTER_PLANNING_DELEGATE_ENABLED=false`) and repeat — expect `planning_direct_frontier` with `fallback_reason: planning_delegate_disabled`.
6. Use `pi router explain` (or `POST /v1/route/explain`) on the same session — `features.planning_delegate` mirrors live routing (`path: delegate` vs `direct`, `fallback_reason` when applicable).

See [routing-roadmap.md](docs/routing-roadmap.md) §2 P0 and GitHub [#71](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/71) for acceptance criteria.

### Adaptive reasoning (thinking level) (#166)

Adaptive reasoning tunes the **thinking intensity of the model already selected** — it never changes which model runs. Per turn class:

| Turn class | Policy level |
|-----------|--------------|
| `tool_result` | `minimal` |
| `main_loop` | `low` |
| planning / `planning_delegate` | `medium` |
| frontier escalation / `loop_escalation` | `high` |

pi passes the session thinking level on every call; the router treats pi's ambient default (`medium`) as adjustable by policy, and any **other** explicit level as an operator `/thinking` floor that is **never lowered** (a turn-class upgrade may still raise it). Chatty profiles (high `verbosity_factor`) additionally get a one-line conciseness nudge at `minimal`/`low`.

**Three knobs that sound alike, do different things:**

| Knob | Acts on | What it changes |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Adaptive reasoning** (`adaptive_reasoning.*`) | The delegated call's `reasoning` option | Thinking *intensity* of the already-selected model — cost of thinking, not model choice |
| `frugality.lambda_verbosity` | Multi-objective **selection** scoring | Which model gets picked — penalizes verbose models while ranking candidates; never touches the delegated call's reasoning option |
| `/thinking` (pi session command) | The caller-provided reasoning level | Explicit operator override — an explicit level is never lowered by policy or bounds |

**Operator knobs** (config `adaptive_reasoning` / env):

| Key | Env var | Default | Effect |
|-----|---------|---------|--------|
| `enabled` | `SMART_ROUTER_ADAPTIVE_REASONING_ENABLED` | `true` | When `false`, the policy is skipped — delegated calls pass the session thinking level through unchanged (`reasoning_reason_code: adaptive_reasoning_disabled`) |
| `min_level` | `SMART_ROUTER_ADAPTIVE_REASONING_MIN_LEVEL` | (none) | Floor: policy-derived levels are raised to at least this level. Discrete level (`minimal\|low\|medium\|high\|xhigh\|max`) — deliberately **not** a free-form verbosity percent |
| `max_level` | `SMART_ROUTER_ADAPTIVE_REASONING_MAX_LEVEL` | (none) | Ceiling: policy-derived levels (incl. turn-class upgrades) are capped at this level. When `min_level` exceeds `max_level` (e.g. via env), the ceiling wins (cost-safe) |

Floor/ceiling bind only what the policy itself derives. An explicit operator `/thinking` choice is never **lowered** by either bound (a floor can still *raise* one via the policy-upgrade path). Both bounds re-clamp down to the model's supported levels.

**Fail-open behavior:** models that do not support reasoning options (`reasoning: false`, or a `thinkingLevelMap` mapping every relevant level to `null`) pass caller options through unchanged — telemetry records `reasoning_reason_code: reasoning_unsupported` and the route never fails. Providers that ignore reasoning options degrade to a no-op.

**Telemetry:** each routed delegation records `reasoning_level_requested` (the session/caller level), `reasoning_level_applied` (the effective delegated level), and `reasoning_reason_code` (e.g. `turn_envelope_main_loop`, `operator_thinking_floor`, `operator_floor_applied`, `operator_ceiling_applied`, `reasoning_unsupported`) on the routing telemetry row — enriched post-delegation like usage actuals ([SP-241](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/164)). Inspect via `/smart-router history`.

### Degraded neural failover sandwich (#119)

When the encoder/neural stage (HyDRA) **fails, is misconfigured, or exceeds its latency budget without a selection**, routing fails open through a cheap chain instead of crashing the host agent ([#119](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/119)):

1. **learned** — optional privacy-safe map keyed by requirement fingerprint (SHA-256 of the rounded requirement vector) or cluster id → preferred tier. **Raw prompt text is never stored.** Exact-key policy: fingerprint match first, cluster id second (no fuzzy matching). Writes are validated (bounded floats, snake_case cluster ids, tier enum) and capped (FIFO eviction) so confounder attacks cannot poison routing memory.
2. **heuristic** — optional operator **pattern pack** (router_rules-style regex overlay) for known-simple intents. Deny-by-default (no match → no decision) and **fail closed on invalid regex** (the rule is rejected at load and never applies).
3. **safe_default** — context-fit aware safe economical/frontier default (`degraded_safe_default`).

Explain/telemetry expose `route_path` (`neural` \| `learned` \| `heuristic` \| `safe_default`) plus `route_path_confidence` on every decision; degraded decisions carry reason codes `degraded_learned_route`, `degraded_pattern_<rule_id>`, or `degraded_safe_default`. A learned/pattern suggestion toward a cheaper tier is only honored when the cheap tool-use cue estimate is below `pattern_tool_use_ceiling` — a cheap overlay **never alone overrides a predicted capability shortfall**.

| Knob (`degraded_route` operator config) | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `enabled` | `true` | When `false`, neural failures use the legacy `safe_default` stage pass-through |
| `learned_min_confidence` | `0.6` | Minimum learned-entry confidence to honor a tier suggestion |
| `learned_max_entries` | `512` | Learned-map cap per key space (FIFO eviction) |
| `pattern_tool_use_ceiling` | `0.3` | Tool-use cue ceiling for honoring cheaper-tier learned/pattern suggestions |
| `fail_closed_on_missing_weights` | `false` | When `true`, missing/placeholder neural weights fail **closed**: the matcher throws before paying embedding cost and the pipeline routes through the degraded sandwich (`neural_misconfigured`) with the SP-251 reason codes on the decision. When `false` (default), routing stays fail-open — placeholder weights score with neutral defaults and the reason codes are advisory telemetry only |

**Missing-weights reason codes (v0.21.0, [#148](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/148)).** When the HyDRA matcher cannot load real neural weights, the decision surfaces structured reason codes (`src/domain/matching/missing-weights-reason-codes.ts`) on the routing decision / `requirement_reason_codes` — visible in explain (`pi router explain` / `POST /v1/route/explain`), `/smart-router history`, and telemetry — not stderr-only:

| Reason code | Meaning | Operator action |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| `hydra_weights_missing` | HyDRA projection-head weights artifact is absent or unloadable, so neural scoring is running on fallback behavior | Restore the weights artifact (see [HyDRA model cache](#hydra-model-cache)); routing continues fail-open unless `fail_closed_on_missing_weights` is set |
| `k4_heads_placeholder` | ModernBERT K4 heads are placeholder (untrained) weights — scores are neutral defaults, not learned predictions | Regenerate/install the trained K4 heads artifact; treat current K4 scores as non-authoritative |

With the default fail-open behavior these codes are advisory: the route proceeds with safe defaults. Set `degraded_route.fail_closed_on_missing_weights: true` when you prefer an explicit degraded-route decision (sandwich chain above, `route_path` records the branch taken) over silently routing on placeholder neural scores.

Distinct from soft heat affinity (healthy-path bias): this is failover / skip-expensive-stage only. Routing remains **pre-generation** — no FrugalGPT-style cascades (see [routing-roadmap.md](docs/routing-roadmap.md) §1).

### Virtual cost v2 (v0.5.0 subscription economics)

**Virtual cost v2** extends SP-096 flat `quota_cost_per_1m` with deterministic subscription-window economics ([#78](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/78)). It inflates effective frontier cost late in a rolling quota window and credits warm prefix-cache value on active pins — without MDP or reinforcement-learning quota policy (SeqRoute HBR+CQL is deferred).

**Formula (per turn)**

`effective_cost_usd = base × λ + quota_arbitrage_premium + exhaustion_risk_premium + kv_cache_savings`

| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `base` | SP-096 subscription virtual cost (`quota_cost_per_1m`) or sticker `fallback_cost_per_1m` |
| **λ (quota decay)** | Multiplier rising from 1 at full window toward `lambda_max_multiplier` as budget depletes |
| **Quota arbitrage premium** | Opportunity-cost uplift for burning subscription quota late in the window |
| **Exhaustion risk premium** | Extra penalty when remaining window fraction falls below `exhaustion_risk_threshold` |
| **KV-cache savings** | Negative credit when pin is active and prefix is warm (`prefix_cache_discount` × `prefix_cache_weight`) |

**Window position**

Rolling-window position is supplied to the router pipeline as `quotaWindowPosition` (library API / telemetry integration). Use `remaining_window_fraction` in `[0, 1]` (1 = full budget). Optionally derive it from elapsed time and consumed quota via `deriveRemainingWindowFraction(elapsed_seconds, consumed_fraction)` in `virtual-cost-v2.ts` (defaults assume a Cursor-style **5h** window).

**Quota window feed (producer, [#125](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/125))**

There is no universal cross-provider "remaining quota" API, so `src/domain/pricing/quota-window-feed.ts` produces the position via an adapter + degrade chain: (1) a provider `QuotaWindowAdapter` when a trustworthy signal exists, (2) a telemetry-derived **pool-level** burn estimate over the rolling window (subscription-pool models = fleet entries with `quota_cost_per_1m`; enabled via `SMART_ROUTER_QUOTA_POOL_BUDGET_TOKENS` + `SMART_ROUTER_QUOTA_WINDOW_SECONDS`), (3) omit → flat virtual cost + SP-097 exhaustion failover. The smart-router extension resolves the feed at fleet rebuild and passes it through `createDispatchOptions` (SP-173 wiring gap closed). Soft bias only — no hard ban at any threshold; SP-097 reactive failover remains the safety net when the feed is missing or stale. Per-model fractions for shared pools are never invented.

When `quotaWindowPosition` is omitted, λ stays at 1 and quota premiums are zero — behavior matches SP-096 flat virtual cost.

**Operator knobs** (`VirtualCostV2Config` — wire through `RouterPipeline` options today; defaults in `DEFAULT_VIRTUAL_COST_V2_CONFIG`):

| Knob | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `window_duration_seconds` | `18000` (5h) | Rolling window length for time-based remaining fraction |
| `lambda_decay_exponent` | `2` | Curvature of λ rise as window depletes |
| `lambda_max_multiplier` | `3` | λ cap at exhaustion |
| `quota_arbitrage_weight` | `0.5` | Weight on late-window arbitrage premium |
| `exhaustion_risk_weight` | `1` | Weight on exhaustion risk below threshold |
| `exhaustion_risk_threshold` | `0.2` | Remaining fraction below which exhaustion premium applies |
| `prefix_cache_discount` | `0.9` | Assumed prefix-cache discount on warm tokens |
| `prefix_cache_weight` | `0.2` | Retained future cache value (aligned with SAAR `SMART_ROUTER_PREFIX_CACHE_WEIGHT`) |

**Where v2 applies**

- **Expected-cost tier selection** — frontier/composer effective cost rises near window exhaustion; economical tiers can win when subscription quota is scarce.
- **Cache breakeven gate** — marginal switch savings and observability use v2 when `quotaWindowPosition` is set; KV credit on the pinned model reduces marginal savings and can block unnecessary pin breaks.

**Dogfood verification**

1. Configure a fleet with subscription `quota_cost_per_1m` on cursor/composer frontier models (see `config/models.yaml.example`).
2. Run routing with `quotaWindowPosition: { remaining_window_fraction: 0.05 }` via library `RouterPipeline` options — inspect `tier_selection` / expected-cost rationale for `v2 λ=`, `quota_premium=`, `exhaustion=`, `cache_credit=` strings.
3. On a warm pinned session with low `remaining_window_fraction`, trigger a `tool_result` sub-route — when cache credit plus reprime math fails breakeven, expect pin hold (`breakeven_blocked`) in routing logs and `features.breakeven` on explain.
4. Compare `remaining_window_fraction: 1` vs `0.02` on the same request — late-window runs should show higher frontier `effective_cost_usd` in `features.tier_selection.tier_costs[].virtual_cost_v2`.

See [routing-roadmap.md](docs/routing-roadmap.md) §2 P2 and GitHub [#78](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/78).

### Usage actuals (post-turn capture)

When pi reports an assistant message `usage` object after a delegated turn, the smart-router persists it onto that turn's routing telemetry row ([#164](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/164)): `actual_cost_usd`, `actual_input_tokens`, `actual_output_tokens`, and cache read/write token counts — while retaining `estimated_cost_usd`. Capture fails open: library embeds and non-pi hosts that report no usage simply leave the actual fields null, and a telemetry write error never fails the route. Subscription/OAuth models report `cost.total === 0`: token actuals are still recorded, but no USD is invented — `/smart-router stats` labels its totals `cost_basis: 'actual' | 'estimated' | 'mixed'` accordingly.

### Rolling cost calibration (v0.20.0 usage actuals)

**Rolling cost calibration** soft-biases future cost estimates with the ratio your models *actually* bill versus what the router estimated ([#164](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/164)). It is built from the privacy-safe post-turn [usage actuals](#usage-actuals-post-turn-capture) — no new state to configure, and prompt/message bodies are never touched.

**How it works**

1. Every routed turn records an `estimated_cost_usd` (input tokens × catalog rate) and, when pi reports it, an `actual_cost_usd` on the same telemetry row.
2. `buildCostCalibrationPrior` derives per-**model** and per-**tier** mean `actual / estimate` ratios over the rolling telemetry window. Per-pair outliers are clamped (±10×) before averaging; the aggregate is clamped to a soft band of **[0.5, 2.0]** so calibration can never hard-ban or hard-favor a model on cost alone.
3. When warm (≥ 3 usable pairs per bucket), the ratio multiplies the tier's base per-1M cost **before** the virtual-cost v2 λ/premium/KV chain — so quota decay and cache credits compound on the calibrated base. Model buckets win over tier buckets.
4. `estimateRoutingCost` accepts the same prior as an optional argument, soft-biasing per-request cost estimates identically.

**Cold start fails open.** No prior, an empty prior, or a bucket below the warmup threshold resolves ratio 1 — the catalog estimate is used unchanged. Subscription rows (host reports `cost.total === 0`) never contribute: stats and calibration never invent USD.

**Where it applies**

- **Expected-cost tier selection** — pass `costCalibration` into `selectTierByExpectedCost` / `computeExpectedCost` (library API, same pattern as `heatBias`). A warm ratio that doubles an economical tier's effective cost can flip the next selection to frontier; the price-delta and pin-economics hard gates still apply after the soft bias.
- **Pre-route estimates** — `estimateRoutingCost(model, request, catalog, calibration?)`; the router pipeline's uncalibrated call is unchanged.
- **`/smart-router stats`** — the aggregate's JSON snapshot (`aggregateSessionStats` / `buildStatsSnapshot`, the automation/MCP surface) carries a `cost_calibration` array (model buckets first, then tier buckets, each `{key, kind, ratio, samples}`); omitted entirely when cold so automation can treat absence as catalog-only. The human-readable stats text keeps rendering cost basis and role breakdown only.

**Observing the bias** — run with `SMART_ROUTER_LOG_ROUTING=1` and read the expected-cost gate line: calibrated winners carry a `[cost-calib ×N.NN from rolling actuals (SP-242)]` note on the rationale, and each tier's `calibrationRatio` appears in the expected-cost breakdown (`features.tier_selection.tier_costs[]`).

**Knobs** (`DEFAULT_COST_CALIBRATION_CONFIG`): `minSamples` 3 (warmup), `minRatio`/`maxRatio` 0.5/2.0 (soft band), `sampleMinRatio`/`sampleMaxRatio` 0.1/10 (per-pair outlier clamp). Not a vendor peak-clock schedule — see [#165](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/165) for time-of-day pricing.

### Peak/off-peak pricing adapters (v0.20.0, #165)

Two vendors publish documented **time-of-day rate cards**. The peak-pricing adapters (`src/domain/pricing/peak-pricing.js`, SP-243) soft-bias the resolved cost-per-1M by the current pricing window — they never hard-ban a model, and non-target providers (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / local / unknown) always resolve `window: 'none'` with multiplier 1 (fail open).

| Vendor | Adapter | Peak window | Off-peak rate | Docs |
|--------|---------|-------------|---------------|------|
| Z.ai GLM Coding Plan | `zai` (matches `zai`/`glm`/`zhipu` providers and `glm-*` ids) | Mon–Fri 14:00–18:00 Asia/Singapore (UTC+8) | 0.5× the standard credit rate | [Z.ai GLM Coding Plan docs](https://docs.z.ai/devpack/overview) |
| DeepSeek pay-as-you-go API | `deepseek` (matches `deepseek` provider / ids) | Mon–Fri 01:00–04:00 and 06:00–10:00 UTC | ½ the peak rate on cache-hit input, cache-miss input, and output | [DeepSeek Models & Pricing](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing) |

**Z.ai plan profiles.** The default plan profile is `credits` — off-peak usage at 0.5× the standard credit rate, peak at 1×. **Legacy plans** (e.g. GLM-5.3 legacy at 3× peak / 1× off-peak, Flash at 1.2× / 0.4×) share the same window but use different multipliers; they are available **only** via an explicit operator override (`PeakPricingConfig.zai`: `plan_profile: 'legacy'` plus documented `peak_multiplier` / `off_peak_multiplier`). The adapter never scrapes the live account plan — legacy multipliers are documented override inputs, not detected state.

**Configuration.** Adapters are on by default; `PeakPricingConfig.enabled: false` returns to flat rates. `PeakPricingConfig.deepseek.off_peak_multiplier` overrides the documented 0.5 off-peak discount if DeepSeek changes its schedule.

**Observing the window.** Every routed turn records `pricing_window: 'peak' | 'off_peak' | 'none'` on its telemetry row (SP-243). With `SMART_ROUTER_LOG_ROUTING=1`, the routing-decision payload surfaces the rationale as top-level `pricing_window` plus `peak_pricing_summary` (`window`, `cost_multiplier`, `adapter_id`) on the canonical `buildRoutingDecisionLogPayload`, and `pricing_window` + `peak_pricing` on the extension stderr logger (SP-244).

### P(success) training export (baseline classifier)

When `SMART_ROUTER_DATASET=1`, the router records privacy-safe dataset rows and behavioral outcome labels. Export labeled training data from pi:

```bash
/smart-router export dataset [--limit N]
```

Each JSONL row joins dataset features with `success_label` and `outcome_signals`. Success means no negative outcome signals were recorded for that `request_id` (for example `model_override` or `feedback_bad` mark failure). Prompt plaintext is never included.

#### Behavioral-first bootstrap (zero manual labels)

Primary path for [#110](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/110) (docs slice).

Manual `/smart-router feedback good|bad` is **optional**. Passive dogfood signals already captured under `SMART_ROUTER_DATASET=1` (and privacy-safe telemetry-contrib export) are sufficient to train when you have enough rows:

| Passive field / signal | Role |
|------------------------|------|
| `model_override` | Failure — operator overrode the routed model (behavioral) |
| `compaction_pin_break` | Neutral/positive context — pin broke at compaction (not a cheap-tier failure by itself) |
| Loop-escalation proxies (`tool_failure_chain`, pin reason `loop_escalation`) | Failure proxies for stuck tool loops (verifier-grade) |
| `stop_reason` / `stop_reason_invalid` / `stop_reason_length` | Execution outcome — invalid or truncated stops mark failure |

The train/aggregate paths derive a label per row (`deriveSuccessLabelFromExportRow` in `src/domain/routing/p-success-classifier.ts`) from the joined `outcome_signals` — **no operator annotation required**:

- **Failure** (`success: false`) if any derived failure signal is present: behavioral (`model_override`, `feedback_bad`), verifier proxies (`tool_failure_chain`, `stop_reason_invalid`, `reprompt_detected`, `high_edit_distance`), or execution (`provider_failover`, `stop_reason_length`, `infra_error`).
- **Success** (`success: true`) on explicit `feedback_good` only.
- **Unlabeled** (`success: null`, skipped by training) when no outcome signals exist, or when only neutral signals such as `compaction_pin_break` were recorded — never coerced to success.

Optional `feedback_good` / `feedback_bad` only refine labels when the operator chooses to annotate; they are not required for a valid train path. **Do not invent labels** — incomplete exports skip or stay unlabeled rather than fabricating outcomes.

**Sample floor:** collect at least **≥30** labeled **economical-tier** rows (`minimum_training_samples.p_success_weights` / `isotonic_calibrator` in [`config/routing-calibration.json.example`](config/routing-calibration.json.example)) before relying on non-neutral `P(success)` or isotonic. Below that floor the classifier returns neutral `P_success_cheap = 0.5`.

**Label provenance (SP-281 / [#168](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/168)):** every labeled export/contrib row may carry `label_provenance` — `human_feedback` (human-rated dogfood turn, [#95](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/95)), `llm_judge` (adversarial harness graders, [#169](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/169)), or `scripted_intent` (scripted pack intent / exit heuristics). **Ship-claim sample floors count only `human_feedback` | `llm_judge` rows** — `scripted_intent` and untagged (legacy) rows never count toward ship floors, and trainers skip `scripted_intent` rows entirely. `scripts/qa/dogfood-gather.sh` auto-tags all of its export output `scripted_intent`; `routing:calibration-aggregate` prints the provenance breakdown, rejects unknown grades, and `--ship-grade-only` emits just the verifier-grade rows for ship trains. Provenance is never invented — absent stays absent (untagged).

**Provenance today (v1.1.0 trained ship):** checked-in `config/p-success-weights.json` and `config/routing-calibration.json` ship `provenance.source: verifier_grade_train_2026-09-12` with `trained_sample_count: 243` for P(success)/isotonic, triage threshold **5** (57 samples, serve-active via #171 loader), HyDRA still 0/≥100. Serve-time routing uses trained expected-cost tier hints (no longer neutral `P=0.5`). Scripted `scripts/qa/dogfood-gather.sh` labels stay **quarantined** (`scripted_intent`) and must not feed ship trains. TwinRouterBench CI corpus soft-fail remains a **harness adapter artifact** ([#112](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/112)). [#95](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/95) / [#110](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/110) stay open for human dogfood volume and HyDRA embeddings.

**v1.1.0 update:** Sep 12 hard gates **PASSED** (ECE cal 0.0645) on 147 `human_feedback` + 96 live `llm_judge` packs — decision record [`hard-gate-pass-2026-09-12.md`](spine-tasks/_authoring/release-v1.1.0/hard-gate-pass-2026-09-12.md) and [migration guide](docs/migration-v1.md#behavioral-calibration-artifacts-110--168). Session-holdout ECE is implemented but not yet ship-cleared ([`session-holdout-retrain-2026-09-12.md`](spine-tasks/_authoring/release-v1.1.0/session-holdout-retrain-2026-09-12.md)). Issue bookkeeping: [`operator-notes-issues.md`](spine-tasks/_authoring/release-v1.1.0/operator-notes-issues.md) — no encoder/frugality default flips; `modernbert_k4` (#96) stays deferred.

**SP-206 / hybrid interim:** July dogfood and a Sept hybrid were explored during the 1.0 train; Sept isotonic collapsed (same-x PAV overwrite) and scripted gather labels failed #110 honesty. Code now pools same-x scores and skips null labels; v1.1 ships verifier-graded weights after the Sep 12 PASS.

**Zero-manual-label path (aggregate → train → verify):**

```bash
# 1) Opt in + dogfood (no /feedback required) — see docs/qa/shadow-dogfood-protocol.md
SMART_ROUTER_DATASET=1
# …sessions with /model smart-router/auto; prefer passive outcomes…
/smart-router export dataset --limit 200
/smart-router export telemetry-contrib

# 2) Aggregate privacy-safe contrib / exports (reject tainted payloads)
npm run routing:calibration-aggregate -- --contrib-dir data/contrib
#    Verifier-grade trains: add --ship-grade-only (human_feedback | llm_judge rows only)

# 3) Train when ≥30 economical-tier labeled rows exist
npm run routing:train-p-success -- --input path/to/export.jsonl --output config/p-success-weights.json
npm run routing:train-calibration -- --input path/to/aggregated.jsonl

# 4) Verify artifact shapes / gates
npm run routing:verify-calibration -- config/routing-calibration.json
```

#### Operator train / reload (no prompt text)

```bash
# Opt in + dogfood, then export privacy-safe labeled JSONL (features + labels only)
SMART_ROUTER_DATASET=1
# …run sessions with /model smart-router/auto (optional: /smart-router feedback)…
/smart-router export dataset --limit 200

# Train standalone weights (≥30 labeled rows required)
npm run routing:train-p-success -- --input path/to/export.jsonl --output config/p-success-weights.json

# Retrain standalone weights from the synthetic fixture (fixture demo only — NOT behavioral;
# the checked-in weights are real dogfood, see "Provenance today" above):
npm run routing:train-p-success

# Optional: merge isotonic into an existing calibration bundle (does not rewrite hydra/centroids)
npm run routing:train-p-success -- --input path/to/export.jsonl \
  --calibration-output config/routing-calibration.json

# Full Phase-3 bundle (also refreshes standalone p-success-weights.json when the gate is met):
npm run routing:train-calibration -- --input path/to/aggregated.jsonl
```

Reload is file-based: replace `config/p-success-weights.json` (and optionally `config/routing-calibration.json` for isotonic) and restart the host agent — no prompt text is ever written into training artifacts.

**Isotonic calibration (shipped trained since v1.1.0):** serve-time isotonic calibration loads from `config/routing-calibration.json` (`isotonic_calibrator`). The checked-in bundle ships a **trained** calibrator (`trained_sample_count: 243`, provenance `verifier_grade_train_2026-09-12`). Below the ≥30 floor or when the bundle is missing, serve-time falls back to identity / neutral `0.5`. Operators who retrain should run `routing:train-calibration` with verifier-grade labels only (not `dogfood-gather.sh` scripted_intent) and `--require-hard-gates`. Explain and telemetry still expose `p_success_raw` vs `p_success_calibrated` / `p_success_cheap`.

Library helpers (see `src/domain/routing/p-success-classifier.ts`):

- `trainFromExportJsonl(exportContent)` — fit coefficients from labeled JSONL
- `predictPSuccessCheap(features, weights)` — returns `P_success_cheap` in `[0, 1]`

**Minimum sample guidance:** collect at least **30** labeled economical-tier rows before relying on non-neutral predictions; below that threshold the classifier returns neutral `P_success_cheap = 0.5`. **Online inference** is active in the low-intensity gate; without trained weights the router uses neutral defaults until you add `config/p-success-weights.json`.

### Community telemetry contribution (calibration)

When `SMART_ROUTER_DATASET=1`, you can export privacy-safe scalar routing features (plus outcome labels) for community calibration training. The export never includes prompt text, messages, raw session identifiers, or install-local pepper fields.

```bash
/smart-router export telemetry-contrib [--limit N] [--embeddings]
# or from shell (cwd must contain .pi-smart-router/state.db):
npx pi-smart-router export telemetry-contrib [--limit N] [--embeddings]
```

This writes schema-valid JSON to `.pi-smart-router/exports/telemetry-contrib-<timestamp>.json`. Each row conforms to [`telemetry-contrib.schema.json`](specs/001-build-smart-router/contracts/telemetry-contrib.schema.json).

**Feature-complete rows (v1.1.0, [#170](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/170)).** Contrib rows now carry additive optional fields within format v2:

- `row_id` — stable per-install HMAC-SHA256 of `request_id` (domain-separated `row:` prefix; raw request ids are never exported). Aggregation dedupes overlapping exports by `row_id`, and training splits stay reproducible as files are added or removed.
- `prompt_length_chars` / `message_count` — count-only envelope fields that feed the P(success) prompt-length feature and edit-distance proxies (previously dropped on this path, starving the feature to zero).
- `embedding` — **double opt-in**: captured only when `SMART_ROUTER_DATASET_EMBEDDINGS=1` was set at routing time, and exported only when you pass `--embeddings`. This is the raw 384-dim encoder vector HyDRA projection training needs to reach its ≥100-row floor; it is a derived dense vector of the metadata-prefixed routing input, never prompt text. `calibration-aggregate` reports how many aggregated rows carry embeddings and warns while the count is below the hydra_projection floor (honest-untrained defaults remain until the floor is met).

**Export schema v2 — session-hash migration (v0.21.0, [#146](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/146)).** The contrib export schema was bumped **v1 → v2** (`TELEMETRY_CONTRIB_VERSION = 2` in `src/cli/smart-router-cli.ts`). In v1, `session_id_hash` was an **unsalted SHA-256** of the raw session id; in v2 it is an **HMAC-SHA256 keyed with an install-local pepper** (`hashSessionIdForTelemetryExport` in `src/infra/telemetry.ts`). The pepper is generated once per install at `.pi-smart-router/.dataset-key` (mode 0600) and is **never** included in export payloads — ingest strips pepper fields before aggregation. Consequences for operators comparing exports:

- Hashes are **stable per install** (same session → same hash within one install/cwd) but **not correlatable across installs** — two machines routing the same prompt produce different hashes.
- **v1 hashes are not comparable with v2 hashes.** If you maintain baselines that join or diff older v1 contrib exports, **re-baseline** on v2 output — do not mix rows across the version boundary.
- Raw `session_id` / `request_id` values never appear in the JSONL in either version.

**How to contribute**

1. Opt in to dataset capture (`SMART_ROUTER_DATASET=1`) and dogfood with `/model smart-router/auto` for several sessions.
2. Run `export telemetry-contrib` locally and review the export — confirm it contains no prompt content.
3. Submit anonymized rows via **pull request** under `data/contrib/` (one `.json` array or `.jsonl` file per install) **or** attach the export to a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/discussions) using the community telemetry template.
4. Maintainers aggregate contributions with `npm run routing:calibration-aggregate -- --contrib-dir data/contrib`; ingest rejects tainted payloads (prompt/message keys) and strips install-local pepper fields before offline training (SP-116, SP-117).

See the synthetic reference file at [`data/contrib/example.json`](data/contrib/example.json).

### OATS cluster centroid refinement (offline calibration)

**OATS** (outcome-aware cluster centroid refinement) shifts semantic cluster centroids during offline calibration toward cheap-tier **success** embeddings and away from loop-escalation **failure** embeddings. Refinement runs in Phase 3 of the calibration train path (`npm run routing:train-calibration`); it adds zero serving latency because refined centroids ship inside `config/routing-calibration.json`.

**Regeneration workflow**

1. Opt in to dataset capture (`SMART_ROUTER_DATASET=1`) and export contrib rows (`/smart-router export telemetry-contrib`).
2. Aggregate community rows: `npm run routing:calibration-aggregate -- --contrib-dir data/contrib`.
3. Train the bundle (includes OATS when enough labeled embeddings exist): `npm run routing:train-calibration -- --input <aggregated.jsonl>`.
4. Copy the output to `config/routing-calibration.json` (or your operator config path).
5. Verify artifact shapes and benchmark gates: `npm run routing:verify-calibration -- config/routing-calibration.json`.

At runtime, `ClusterMatcher` prefers `routing_centroids` from the calibration bundle when `config/routing-calibration.json` is present; otherwise it falls back to `config/routing-centroids.json` (bootstrap via `npm run routing:bootstrap-centroids`).

**Hyperparameters** (tunable in `scripts/lib/oats-centroid-refinement.ts` before train):

| Parameter | Default | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `alpha` (α) | 0.15 | Attraction toward cheap-tier success embeddings |
| `beta` (β) | 0.08 | Repulsion from loop-escalation failures (keep β < α) |

**Minimum sample guidance**

| Guard | Default | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Global `routing_centroids` | 10 rows | Labeled contrib rows with embeddings required before any OATS shift |
| `min_positive_samples` | 3 per cluster | Cheap-tier successes assigned to the cluster |
| `min_negative_samples` | 2 per cluster | Loop-escalation failures before repulsion term applies |

Below these thresholds the train path returns bootstrap centroids unchanged. The verify script reports `oats_refinement` metadata when refinement ran.

These guards match `DEFAULT_OATS_MIN_POSITIVE_SAMPLES` / `DEFAULT_OATS_MIN_NEGATIVE_SAMPLES` in `scripts/lib/oats-centroid-refinement.ts` and `MINIMUM_TRAINING_SAMPLES.routing_centroids` (10) in `scripts/calibration-aggregate.ts`. The same global floors appear under `minimum_training_samples` in [`config/routing-calibration.json.example`](config/routing-calibration.json.example) (`hydra_projection` 100, `triage_thresholds` 50, `p_success_weights` / `isotonic_calibrator` 30, `routing_centroids` 10).

See [routing-roadmap.md](docs/routing-roadmap.md) §2 P2 OATS and GitHub [#77](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/77).

### Privacy-safe label packs + calibration dry-run (SP-189–SP-191 / #102)

Offline **label packs** are feature-vector + binary-outcome JSONL (never prompt/message text). Schema: `scripts/lib/label-pack-schema.ts`. Provenance, pins, and field maps: [`tests/eval/corpus/label-packs/PROVENANCE.md`](tests/eval/corpus/label-packs/PROVENANCE.md).

**Regenerate packs (offline / no network for CI fixtures):**

```bash
# SWE-Gym verifier-style → pack
npm run routing:ingest-swe-gym -- \
  --input tests/eval/corpus/label-packs/swe-gym/ci-fixture.jsonl \
  --output /tmp/swe-gym-pack.jsonl

# FC-RewardBench preference / flat → pack
npm run routing:ingest-fc-rewardbench -- \
  --input tests/eval/corpus/label-packs/fc-rewardbench/ci-fixture.jsonl \
  --output /tmp/fc-rewardbench-pack.jsonl

# Optional weak TwinRouterBench tier proxy (exclude from holdout ECE)
# Preferred input: checked-in CI subset (SP-199/SP-201); full-track after SP-200 is local-only.
npm run routing:ingest-twinrouterbench-weak -- \
  --input tests/eval/corpus/twinrouterbench/ci-subset.json \
  --output /tmp/trb-weak-from-ci-subset.jsonl

npm run routing:ingest-twinrouterbench-weak -- \
  --input tests/eval/corpus/label-packs/twinrouterbench-weak/ci-fixture.jsonl \
  --output /tmp/trb-weak-pack.jsonl
```

**Calibration dry-run (holdout ECE):**

```bash
# CI fixtures (ingests packs in-memory; sample-starved → report-only)
npm run routing:calibration-dry-run

# Operator packs (schema-valid JSONL)
npm run routing:calibration-dry-run -- --packs /tmp/swe-gym-pack.jsonl /tmp/fc-rewardbench-pack.jsonl

# Warm-start: weak / exclude_from_holdout_ece rows join the **fit** pool only
npm run routing:calibration-dry-run -- \
  --packs /tmp/swe-gym-pack.jsonl /tmp/trb-weak-from-ci-subset.jsonl \
  --include-excluded-in-fit

# Soft ECE advisory fail (threshold 0.25 calibrated ECE; not a release-gate absolute)
npm run routing:calibration-dry-run -- --packs /tmp/swe-gym-pack.jsonl --enforce-soft-ece
```

Dry-run behavior:

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| &lt; 30 ECE-eligible rows | `SAMPLE_STARVED` report-only (exit 0); no soft pass/fail |
| ≥ 30 ECE-eligible rows | Fit logistic + isotonic; report `holdout_ece_raw` / `holdout_ece_calibrated` |
| Rows with `exclude_from_holdout_ece` | Counted separately; **never** enter holdout ECE metrics (weak TwinRouterBench) |
| `--include-excluded-in-fit` | Weak rows may warm-start the fit pool; `ece_eligible` / holdout ECE stay verifier-grade |
| Soft threshold | Advisory `0.25` calibrated ECE — **does not** change `config/release-gates.json` |

**#96 / `modernbert_k4` advisory:** when deciding whether to enable ModernBERT K=4 heads, use **pack holdout ECE / Top-1 error on verifier-grade packs** (SWE-Gym + FC-RewardBench), not fixture-only QR and **not** weak-fit ECE. Weak TwinRouterBench rows are warm-start only. This task does **not** flip `modernbert_k4` defaults. Go/no-go evidence (SP-204 / #113): [`spine-tasks/_authoring/release-v0.11.0/encoder-gonogo-artifact.md`](spine-tasks/_authoring/release-v0.11.0/encoder-gonogo-artifact.md). K=4 Top-1 / offline A/B decision (SP-219 / #114): [`spine-tasks/_authoring/release-v0.16.0/modernbert-k4-top1-artifact.md`](spine-tasks/_authoring/release-v0.16.0/modernbert-k4-top1-artifact.md) — recommendation: **keep default** (gate not measurable without trained heads; #96 open).

### Operator tuning (frugality slider)

The multi-objective scoring weights control the cost-vs-quality tradeoff:

| Key | Default | Effect |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `frugality.lambda_cost` | 0.5 | Higher favors cheaper models at quality parity |
| `frugality.lambda_latency` | 0.1 | Higher penalizes slow models |
| `frugality.lambda_verbosity` | 0.15 | Higher penalizes verbose models |

Additional operator defaults:

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `loop_escalation.threshold` | 3 | Consecutive identical failures before escalating to frontier. Also used as the default **zero-tier tool-call churn** threshold (SP-178 / [#99](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/99)): while pinned to `zero-tier`, unsupported/unknown tool results escalate immediately, and N `tool_result` turns escalate via the same `loop_escalation` pin path (FR-014) — not a cache-breakeven bypass |
| `pin_only_fallback` | `false` | Emergency pin-on-first-turn mode — see [Pin-only emergency fallback](#pin-only-emergency-fallback) |
| `local_zero.enabled` | `true` | When `false`, skip `local_zero` dispatch (fall through to later stages). Default keeps the cheap local path for true trivial traffic |
| `local_zero.max_tool_use_requirement` | `0.25` | Ceiling (0–1) on cheap predicted tool_use for `local_zero`. Effective limit is `min(local model tool_use, this value)`. Skips agentic git/bash/edit/explore/delete/repo cues with telemetry reason `tool_use_capability_shortfall` (SP-177 / [#98](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/98)) |
| `local.min_memory_gb_full` | 16 | Minimum RAM for full local inference |
| `local.battery_threshold_pct` | 20 | Minimum battery to allow local inference |
| `pricing.staleness_days` | 14 | Max age before re-fetching pricing data |

### Pin-only emergency fallback

**Not the default policy.** Multi-stage routing remains the design target. Enable `pin_only_fallback` only when shadow quality retention regresses or as a manual operator safety valve (GitHub [#83](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/83), [routing-roadmap.md](docs/routing-roadmap.md) §1).

When `pin_only_fallback` is `true` in `config/operator-config.json`:

1. **First turn** — normal multi-stage routing runs and establishes the session pin.
2. **Subsequent turns** — the router reuses the pinned model, skipping `turn_envelope`, triage, HyDRA, and sub-routing (`reason_code: pin_only_fallback`).

**Manual trigger:** set `"pin_only_fallback": true` in operator config and restart or reload config. Revert to `false` when shadow metrics recover.

**Automated trigger (eval harness):** compare shadow QR from `npm run routing:eval-harness` against a frozen baseline aggregate. When mean quality retention drops more than **5 percentage points** (default threshold), enable pin-only fallback:

```bash
# Score current fixtures
npm run routing:eval-harness:smoke > shadow-metrics.json

# Compare against a saved baseline (same catalog_id + checkpoint_date)
node --import tsx -e "
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import { evaluatePinOnlyFallbackFromHarness } from './scripts/eval/quality-retention.ts';
const shadow = JSON.parse(readFileSync('shadow-metrics.json','utf8')).tracks.capability;
const baseline = JSON.parse(readFileSync('baseline-metrics.json','utf8')).tracks.capability;
const result = evaluatePinOnlyFallbackFromHarness(shadow, baseline);
console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
if (result.pin_only_fallback) process.exit(2);
"
```

Exit code `2` signals regression above threshold — operators can wire this into CI or a config reload hook. Override semantics: explicit `pin_only_fallback: true` in config always enables emergency mode; explicit `false` disables the automated recommendation.

**Telemetry:** when fallback routes a request, telemetry rows include `pin_only_fallback_active: true` (and `reason_code: pin_only_fallback`). Filter operator audit logs on that field to confirm emergency mode is active.

### HyDRA model cache

The embedding matcher uses `@huggingface/transformers` with ONNX models (384-dim embeddings). Artifacts are downloaded at runtime and cached under `.pi-smart-router/models/` (configurable via `hydra.artifact_cache_path`). This directory is gitignored.

**Abort / cancel limitation (SP-171):** `AbortSignal` is checked at phase boundaries before fleet refresh, HyDRA/dispatch, planning delegate, and each failover iteration. Mid-ONNX embedding inference cannot be cancelled — abort is fail-fast only before or after that stage, not during an in-flight ONNX run.

| Encoder | Model | Context | Default |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|
| `minilm` | `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | 512 tokens | yes |
| `granite` | `ibm-granite/granite-embedding-97m-multilingual-r2` (ONNX) | long context | trial (#80) |

Set the encoder in operator config:

```json
{
  "hydra": {
    "artifact_cache_path": ".pi-smart-router/models/",
    "encoder": "granite"
  }
}
```

MiniLM remains the default fallback when `encoder` is omitted. Both encoders produce 384-dim vectors compatible with the SP-115 learned projection head.

**Opt-in per-prompt encoder cascade ([#173](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/173), v1.2.0 — default OFF).** Instead of a process-wide single encoder, an opt-in gate routes prompts whose estimated token count reaches a threshold to the long-context encoder, avoiding MiniLM's 512-token truncation on long turns:

```json
{
  "hydra": {
    "artifact_cache_path": ".pi-smart-router/models/",
    "encoder": "minilm",
    "encoder_cascade": {
      "enabled": true,
      "long_context_encoder": "granite",
      "token_threshold": 512
    }
  }
}
```

- **Default off** — existing single-encoder installs are unaffected and pay zero added cost (the gate is pre-embedding arithmetic, ~sub-microsecond p50 in replay).
- **Lazy memory** — the Granite ONNX session loads only on the first over-threshold prompt; short prompts keep using the same MiniLM session, so their routing decisions are identical to the MiniLM-only baseline.
- **Degrade, never mix** — encoders embed into different vector spaces. If Granite is unavailable at request time, routing continues on MiniLM with `granite_fallback` telemetry; the cascade never compares cross-encoder vectors. Per-encoder artifacts: bootstrap Granite centroids with `npm run routing:bootstrap-centroids -- --encoder granite` (namespaced `config/routing-centroids.granite.json`); `npm run routing:verify-calibration` rejects mixed-encoder bundles, and Granite-side projection ships honest-untrained.
- **Telemetry** — cascade-enabled decisions carry `encoder_selected`, `token_estimate`, `cascade_threshold`, and `cascade_fallback_reason` on the feature sidecar.
- **Evidence, not a default flip** — see the cascade replay report [`docs/qa/encoder-cascade-replay-v1.2.0.md`](docs/qa/encoder-cascade-replay-v1.2.0.md). Promoting the cascade (or Granite) to a default is a future ticket gated on the #173 eval table.

**Latency budget:** the HyDRA embedding stage targets ~80–120 ms per turn. Compare MiniLM vs Granite on held-out agent turn samples:

```bash
npm run benchmark:encoder
# optional: --fixtures path --cache .pi-smart-router/models/
```

The script reports p50/p95 latency for each encoder and asserts Granite p50/p95 stay within the 120 ms budget ceiling. Requires `@huggingface/transformers` and a one-time ONNX artifact download.

#### Granite opt-in dogfood runbook ([#167](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/167))

Operator enablement for the Granite 97M long-context encoder on dogfood installs. **MiniLM remains the shipped default** — this runbook never flips `encoder` defaults; promotion is decided only through [#96](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/96) with dogfood evidence. The code path already shipped in [#80](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/80); do not reimplement it.

**1. Fetch the model.** No manual download step is required — the ONNX artifact fetches on demand:

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Runtime HF ONNX id | `onnx-community/granite-embedding-97m-multilingual-r2-ONNX` (`GRANITE_ONNX_MODEL` in `src/domain/matching/embedding-provider.ts`) |
| Upstream weights | `ibm-granite/granite-embedding-97m-multilingual-r2` (384-dim, long context) |
| Cache dir | `hydra.artifact_cache_path` (default `.pi-smart-router/models/` — gitignored) |
| Fetch trigger | First HyDRA embed with `encoder: granite`, **or** `npm run benchmark:encoder` (downloads on demand) |
| Offline | One-time Hugging Face download; fully offline after cache warm (see Supply-chain below for pin modes) |

Expected cache layout after fetch:

```text
.pi-smart-router/models/onnx-community/granite-embedding-97m-multilingual-r2-ONNX/
```

**2. Switch config (operator).** Edit `config/operator-config.json` on the dogfood host:

```json
{
  "hydra": {
    "artifact_cache_path": ".pi-smart-router/models/",
    "encoder": "granite",
    "hydra_heads": "learned_projection"
  }
}
```

Keep `hydra_heads: learned_projection` — Granite stays 384-dim compatible with the SP-115 projection (`config/hydra-projection-weights.json`). Do **not** enable `modernbert_k4` (still blocked on trained `config/modernbert-k4-heads.json`; tracked by #96).

**3. Verify resident.** After a routed request, run `/smart-router plan` or `/smart-router doctor` to confirm the Granite encoder model and cache path are loaded. Smoke-check that routing still selects tiers and that there is **no silent MiniLM fallback** — if the encoder errors or exceeds budget, the neural stage fails open by design (#119 / #148) and telemetry/`reason_code` surfaces it; a crash or silent downgrade is a bug, not expected behavior.

**4. Measure and archive.** Run the encoder benchmark and archive output for the issue trail:

```bash
mkdir -p .pi-smart-router/measurements/
npm run benchmark:encoder | tee .pi-smart-router/measurements/benchmark-encoder-$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
# optional: --fixtures path --cache .pi-smart-router/models/
```

Expectation: Granite p50/p95 within the ≤120 ms HyDRA embedding-stage budget (SP-204 go/no-go measured ~17 ms p50 for both encoders; [artifact](spine-tasks/_authoring/release-v0.11.0/encoder-gonogo-artifact.md)). `.pi-smart-router/measurements/` is gitignored — post a short summary comment on #167 with the numbers.

**5. Post-switch follow-ups (feed #96 — evidence only, no default flip).** Track after Granite is live on the dogfood host:

- **Latency regression watch** — HyDRA stage stays within ~80–120 ms on dogfood hardware vs SP-204 baselines; re-run `npm run benchmark:encoder` after fleet/catalog changes.
- **Centroid / cluster space** — centroids were bootstrapped with MiniLM (`npm run routing:bootstrap-centroids`). Same 384-dim space, but embedding geometry differs; dry-run compare cluster match quality under Granite and document whether `config/routing-centroids.json` / the calibration bundle need refresh **before** any default flip.
- **Projection / calibration** — SP-115 weights were trained on MiniLM embeddings. Run `npm run routing:calibration-dry-run` under Granite; if holdout ECE worsens, retrain the projection **or** keep MiniLM as the shipped default.
- **Truncation / quality signal** — confirm long agent turns no longer hit MiniLM's 512-token wall (the primary motivation); note any residual encoder truncation surfaced in explain/telemetry.
- **Degraded / fail-open path** — with Granite ONNX missing or slow, confirm neural failover still fails open (#119 / #148) rather than crashing the host agent.
- **Feed #96** — after dogfood evidence, comment on #96 with *promote Granite as default?* yes/no + evidence. Only then open a separate issue/PR to flip defaults — never from dogfood alone (see `docs/qa/shadow-dogfood-protocol.md`).
- **Do not conflate with ModernBERT** — K=4 stays blocked on trained `config/modernbert-k4-heads.json` (SP-218/219); out of scope here.

#### Supply-chain: artifact pins, offline cache, and audit posture

**Digest pinning (SP-259, [#147](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/147)).** The embedder verifies cached ONNX artifacts against SHA-256 pins before they are used. Pins live in [`config/onnx-artifact-pins.json`](config/onnx-artifact-pins.json) (`pins[modelId][cacheRelativePath] = sha256`; digests are the HuggingFace LFS oids for the default quantized artifacts). Pin mode is controlled by `SMART_ROUTER_ONNX_PIN_MODE`:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `off` (default) | No verification — first run downloads unpinned (local dogfood preserved). |
| `verify` | Configured pins are verified after load; models without pins still download unpinned. |
| `enforce` | CI/prod: pins are **required** for the loaded model — missing pin file, missing pins for the model, missing cached artifact, or any digest mismatch all fail closed. |

Override the pin file location with `SMART_ROUTER_ONNX_PIN_FILE`. Verification runs **after** the transformers.js pipeline loads but **before** the embedder is returned, so even a first-run anonymous download is checked against configured pins — tampered or unexpected bytes fail closed and the session is never usable. Anonymous fetch does not silently bypass pins when they are configured. When upgrading model revisions, re-fetch digests from the HuggingFace API out-of-band and update the pin file; never pin a digest you have not verified.

**Offline / air-gapped cache warm.** The artifact cache (`hydra.artifact_cache_path`, default `.pi-smart-router/models/`) is fully self-contained once warmed:

1. On a networked host, warm the cache with the encoder you deploy — run any routed request, or `npm run benchmark:encoder -- --cache .pi-smart-router/models/`.
2. Enable pin mode (`verify` or `enforce`) during the warm so digest mismatches surface on the networked host, before rollout.
3. Copy the cache directory (and `config/onnx-artifact-pins.json` when pinning) to the offline host and point `hydra.artifact_cache_path` at the copy.
4. Defense in depth: embedders can set `env.allowRemoteModels = false` (from `@huggingface/transformers`) before routing to forbid any network fetch, so no anonymous download path exists in production.

**`npm audit` posture for the transformers chain.** The audit baseline includes high-severity advisories in `@huggingface/transformers` → `onnxruntime-node` → `adm-zip` ([GHSA-xcpc-8h2w-3j85](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xcpc-8h2w-3j85) — crafted ZIP triggers a 4GB memory allocation) and `sharp` (libvips CVEs), both **with no upstream fix available**. Accepted-risk rationale:

- Model bytes in the pinned production path come only from the operator-controlled local cache, verified by SHA-256 — the vulnerable archive-decompression path is not exposed to untrusted input there.
- Inference runs locally with no gradients and no untrusted deserialization; untrusted bytes enter only on first cache warm, over TLS from the HuggingFace hub, and (with pin mode on) are digest-checked before use.

**Monitoring policy:** run `npm audit` at each release and record the baseline. A *new* high-severity advisory in the transformers/onnxruntime chain requires a documented exception with rationale (release notes or a linked issue) — never silently dismiss; exceptions without rationale are release blockers.

## Architecture

### Three execution tiers

| Tier | Catalog Name | Purpose | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Local | `zero-tier` | Free on-device inference for trivial tasks | Gemma via LM Studio |
| Cheap Cloud | `economical-cloud` | Budget API models for routine work | Claude Haiku |
| Frontier Cloud | `frontier-cloud` | Top-tier models for complex reasoning | Claude Sonnet |

### Pi extension

The pi integration path (npm install or project-local clone):

- Registers provider **`smart-router`** with model **`auto`**
- Implements **`streamSimple`** — runs the pipeline, resolves the target in `ModelRegistry`, delegates to the built-in streaming API for that provider
- Wires lifecycle hooks via `router.register()` for session state:

| Event | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `session_compact` / `session_before_compact` | Breaks session pin on compaction (via `LifecycleHookState`) |
| `model_select` | Records user-forced model overrides when `source === "set"` |
| `session_start` | Restores fleet mode from session entries |

Conversation context for routing is read from the stream delegation path (`buildRoutingRequest`), not from a library `context` hook. Library embedders supply `messages` / `prompt_text` when calling `dispatch.dispatch()`.

### Session pinning

Sessions pin to the first routed model to preserve provider-side prompt prefix caching. Pins break only on:

- Session compaction
- User model override (`/model` in pi)
- Loop escalation (repeated identical tool failures)
- Cache-warmup economics threshold

Sub-routing within a pin is allowed: small `tool_result` turns may use an economical model on the same provider without breaking the pin.

### Gateway resilience

The `GatewayDispatch` layer wraps the pipeline with:

- **Circuit breaker** — Per-model, tracks consecutive 5xx/network errors (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN). 4xx and safety errors do not trip the breaker.
- **Failover chains** — On open circuit, routes to same-tier alternative via inverse-cost weighted selection.
- **Rate limiting** — Per-operator-key token bucket with `429 + Retry-After` responses.

### Troubleshooting

#### Gemini `thought_signature` 400 errors

If Gemini returns **400 INVALID_ARGUMENT** mentioning `thought_signature`, the router treats this as a **protocol validation error** (incomplete tool-call replay), not provider unavailability — it is never classified as an infrastructure failure and never trips the circuit breaker. If the error survives repair and the tool-history guard, the router fails over **once** to a non-Google fleet model automatically (telemetry `reason_code: gemini_replay_incompatible`, distinct from infra failover) so the agent loop continues; only when no non-Google candidate exists does it surface a terminal error with actionable guidance.

See [Google's thought signatures documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/generate-content/thought-signatures).

**Primary path — silent repair and reroute (SP-127/128, SP-231/232):** in the common cross-provider case (tool-heavy turns on OpenAI/Anthropic/GLM/Cursor, then a Gemini selection) you do **not** need `/new` or manual model switching. Before every Google-target delegation, smart-router repairs tool-call replay state for **any** prior provider: unsigned tool calls receive the Google-accepted skip sentinel, captured signatures are preserved, and assistant identity aligns so pi-ai replays the turns without a 400. When history carries replay state repair cannot make Google-safe, the tool-history guard silently reroutes to a non-Google model instead (`reason_code: gemini_tool_history_excluded`) — see below.

**Guard fail-safe (SP-129, expanded SP-232):** sessions with **unrepairable** replay state exclude Gemini from routing unless the operator sets `force_model_id` via `/model`. Unrepairable means: Google-origin turns with redacted thinking or captured signatures (SP-129), and — after SP-232 — **cross-provider** turns whose state repair preserves but Google rejects, such as foreign provider signatures (Claude signed thinking, signed text, or signed tool calls) or redacted thinking from any origin replayed toward a Google target. Unsigned cross-provider tool calls alone are repairable and stay routable to Gemini.

**Empty fleet fail-safe (SP-084):** when the guard filters every model in the scoped fleet (e.g. Google/Gemini-only dogfood configs with unrepairable replay risk), the router throws an actionable error instead of delegating with `selected_model_id: unknown`. Add a non-Google model such as `openai/gpt-4o-mini` or `cursor/auto` to the fleet, or pin `/model` to force a specific model.

**Residual path — one-shot non-Google failover (SP-233):** when a `thought_signature` 400 still reaches the stream (repair could not make the session replay state Google-safe), smart-router selects at most one non-Google fleet member and continues the stream with it. This is protocol-affinity failover, not infra failover: it is not recorded as a provider outage, does not trip the circuit breaker, and never retries Gemini↔Gemini for this error. If the scoped fleet has no non-Google model, the router fails fast with terminal guidance instead of looping silently.

**If you still see a `thought_signature` error:**

1. Add a non-Google model (e.g. `openai/gpt-4o-mini` or `cursor/auto`) to the scoped fleet so the residual failover can reroute automatically — or switch manually with `/model openai/gpt-4o-mini` for that session.
2. Start a fresh session with `/new` in pi (clears unrepairable history) — last resort, rarely needed outside Google-only fleets or residual edge cases.
3. Upstream: [pi#6342](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6342) tracks pi preserving thought signatures in session replay; smart-router repair covers the common cross-model routing case without waiting on that fix.

Related: [pi-smart-router#37](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/37), [pi-smart-router#38](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/38), [pi-smart-router#40](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/40), [pi-smart-router#41](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/41), [pi-smart-router#85](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/85), [pi-smart-router#158](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/158), [pi-smart-router#159](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/159).

### Explain endpoint (library API)

The explain handler runs the identical pipeline but returns the `RoutingDecision` without dispatching upstream inference — guaranteeing bit-for-bit decision equivalence with the live path. Useful for debugging, operator trust, and shadow runs. Exposed via the library API (`src/api/explain/router-explain.ts`); HTTP/CLI wiring is embedder-specific.

## API

### Public exports

```typescript
import {
  createRouter,
  createRouterFromFleet,
  createPiRouterMiddleware,
  LifecycleHookState,
  type RoutingDecision,
  type ModelProfile,
  type PiRouterMiddleware,
  type PiExtensionHooks,
  type RouterHandle,
} from 'pi-smart-router';
```

`createPiRouterMiddleware()` is exported for advanced embedders that need a standalone lifecycle hook registrar. Most callers should use `createRouter()` / `createRouterFromFleet()` and call `register()` on the returned handle.

### `RoutingDecision`

Every routing decision includes:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `selected_model_id` | `string` | Fleet model ID chosen |
| `tier` | `Tier` | `zero-tier`, `economical-cloud`, or `frontier-cloud` |
| `stage` | `string` | Pipeline stage that decided (triage, session_pin, local_zero, etc.) |
| `reason_code` | `string` | Machine-readable reason |
| `candidates` | `string[]` | Models considered before selection |
| `estimated_cost_usd` | `number` | Per-request cost estimate |
| `routing_latency_ms` | `number` | Time spent in the routing pipeline |

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router.git
cd pi-smart-router
npm install
npm run build
npm run verify:ci
```

Contributors must run `npm run build` before publishing or consuming the library API from `dist/`. The pi extension uses TypeScript source directly (via pi's jiti loader) and does not require a local build for clone-based dogfooding.

### Offline eval harness (agent-native routing)

The eval harness scores routing decisions on **fixture traces** — multi-turn agent sessions with step-level `prefix_hash` identifiers and frozen model catalog metadata. Fixtures live under `tests/eval/fixtures/` (native eval trace JSON) and `tests/eval/fixtures/twinrouterbench/` (TwinRouterBench-compatible static track format adapted at load time).

**Frozen catalog rule:** every published QR/CS number must cite `catalog_id` + `checkpoint_date` from the fixture's `frozen_catalog` block (see `docs/routing-roadmap.md` §5).

Run locally:

```bash
# Full metrics JSON (per-fixture + aggregate track summaries)
npm run routing:eval-harness

# CI-style summary only (default fixtures under tests/eval/fixtures)
npm run routing:eval-harness:smoke

# TwinRouterBench CI corpus subset (≤150 code/tool records; offline)
npm run routing:eval-harness:corpus-smoke

# Custom fixture directory (includes TwinRouterBench static track subdirs)
npm run routing:eval-harness -- --fixtures tests/eval/fixtures

# Counterfactual replay only (SP-151)
npm run routing:eval-replay

# Full ~970-row static track (local / nightly only — do not check JSON into git)
npm run routing:twinrouterbench:full-track
```

**CI smoke:** `.github/workflows/eval-harness-smoke.yml` runs on PRs that touch eval scripts, fixtures, **any `src/**` or `.pi/extensions/smart-router/**` change**, or the workflow. It executes `routing:eval-harness:smoke`, `routing:eval-harness:corpus-smoke`, and eval unit tests — fast, offline, no provider network calls. Job timeout stays at 10 minutes. The optional full-track nightly (`.github/workflows/twinrouterbench-full-nightly.yml`, `schedule` + `workflow_dispatch` only) is **not** on `pull_request` and must not be configured as a required status check — failures there do not gate PR CI or `release:functional-smoke`.

**Calibration verify:** `.github/workflows/calibration-verify.yml` runs on PRs that touch calibration config/scripts (`config/routing-calibration.json*`, `config/p-success-weights.json`, `scripts/train-routing-calibration.ts`, `scripts/verify-routing-calibration.ts`, `scripts/lib/isotonic-calibrator.ts`, `scripts/lib/oats-centroid-refinement.ts`) **or calibration-consuming routing code** (`src/domain/routing/**`, `src/domain/pipeline/**`, `src/domain/types/**`, `src/cli/**`). It builds the library and verifies `config/routing-calibration.json.example` against benchmark prompts via `npm run routing:verify-calibration`.

**TwinRouterBench static track:** import step-level router-visible prefixes with execution-verified target tiers (`track: "static"`). The adapter in `scripts/eval/twinrouterbench-adapter.ts` converts static track records into native eval fixtures for the three-track harness. See `docs/gemini-research.md` §9 for methodology context.

**Absolute release gates stay on default fixtures.** `npm run release:functional-smoke` continues to assert `tests/eval/fixtures` against `config/release-gates.json` — do not point it at the corpus without operator review. Today the corpus subset fails `mean_over_routing_rate_max` (≈0.85 vs absolute max 0.15); that gap is intentional soft signal for the [#95](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/95) public static-track acceptance criteria alongside live dogfood traces. Use `--fixtures tests/eval/corpus/twinrouterbench` (or the corpus-report script) for #95 public-track scoring; keep absolute threshold edits out of band until operators approve. For live shadow dogfood steps and sign-off, see the [shadow dogfood protocol](docs/qa/shadow-dogfood-protocol.md).

#### TwinRouterBench full static track (SP-200 / #107)

First-class **local / optional nightly** path for the pinned ~970-row bank. **Do not check the full JSON into git.**

| Item | Location / command |
|------|--------------------|
| **One-shot** | `npm run routing:twinrouterbench:full-track` |
| **Cache (gitignored)** | `.pi-smart-router/eval-cache/twinrouterbench/` (override with `TRB_CACHE_DIR`) |
| **Steps** | pin fetch → `routing:ingest-twinrouterbench` **without** `--limit` → harness `--summary-only` + gates `--report-only` |
| **Nightly** | `.github/workflows/twinrouterbench-full-nightly.yml` (`schedule` + `workflow_dispatch`) — advisory only |
| **Provenance** | `tests/eval/corpus/twinrouterbench/PROVENANCE.md` |

PR corpus smoke remains the vendored ≤150 subset. Absolute `config/release-gates.json` thresholds and `release:functional-smoke` stay fixture-backed.

**[#95 dual-gate protocol](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/95):** (1) live shadow dogfood (`docs/qa/shadow-dogfood-protocol.md` · `npm run qa:shadow-dogfood`, plus `npm run qa:dogfood-soft-feed` to attach labeled dogfood exports to the gates as a dry-run) and (2) public static-track soft-feed (CI subset report, or full-track report above). Neither path edits absolute release thresholds.

**Deferred:** RouterBench classic (outcome-matrix) smoke is out of scope for SP-188; prefer TwinRouterBench static track + dogfood for #95.

#### LLMRouterBench offline regret (SP-192 / SP-193)

Optional local / nightly report on the **pinned code/tool subset** — not part of PR CI (no full HF corpus download).

| Item | Location / command |
|------|--------------------|
| **Pinned upstream** | HF `NPULH/LLMRouterBench` `@0e5af1b84bf73437a01a1849c0f1d2468baa93fc` + git schema `@c77cb0506949d8f959e97967d2fefca0e8ff1b05` (MIT) |
| **CI subset** | `tests/eval/corpus/llmrouterbench/ci-subset.json` (≤20 synthetic offline records) |
| **Provenance / refresh** | `tests/eval/corpus/llmrouterbench/PROVENANCE.md` (quarterly pin refresh; re-run report after catalog/subset changes) |
| **Regenerate subset** | `npm run routing:ingest-llmrouterbench -- --input <jsonl> --output tests/eval/corpus/llmrouterbench/ci-subset.json --limit 20 --prefer-code-tool` |
| **Regret / CS report** | `npm run routing:llmrouterbench-regret` |
| **Community Track C** | `npm run routing:community-bench -- --llmrouterbench` (same vendored subset; optional) |

PR CI continues to smoke TwinRouterBench only (`routing:eval-harness:corpus-smoke`). Absolute `config/release-gates.json` thresholds are unchanged. See [Contribute a community bench report](#contribute-a-community-bench-report) for Track A + optional Track C sharing.

It includes a `Subject:` line, privacy blurb, fingerprint, Track A PASS/FAIL, and optional Track B/C metrics. Paste into your mail client; attach `community-bench-report.json` if useful. Do **not** expect the CLI to send mail.
2. **GitHub issue** — open the [maintainer contact](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/new?labels=community-bench) URL, or run with `--print-issue-body` and paste stdout into a new issue. Issues list: https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues

**Tracks:**

| Track | Corpus | When |
|-------|--------|------|
| **A (required)** | [TwinRouterBench CI corpus](#twinrouterbench-ci-corpus-sp-186--sp-187--sp-188) (`tests/eval/corpus/twinrouterbench`) | Always |
| **B (optional)** | Labeled dogfood export (`--dogfood-export PATH`) | Runs when adapter + export present with required outcome labels (`success_label`, `min_tier`, `min_model_id`); skips with an explicit reason when incomplete — never invents labels. Example: `tests/eval/dogfood-track-b/synthetic-labeled-export.json` ([#111](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/111)) |
| **C (optional)** | [LLMRouterBench offline subset](#llmrouterbench-offline-regret-sp-192--sp-193) (`tests/eval/corpus/llmrouterbench`) | `--llmrouterbench` or `--full`; offline only |

PR CI does **not** download full TwinRouterBench / LLMRouterBench corpora. Absolute gate thresholds in `config/release-gates.json` are unchanged by this CLI.

Sample fixtures under `tests/eval/fixtures/twinrouterbench/` remain the small adapter unit-test inputs and are unchanged by corpus ingest.

Capability scores in `config/benchmark-profiles.json` are grounded from public leaderboard snapshots under `tests/fixtures/benchmark-leaderboards/` (and optional **recorded** live snapshots under `tests/fixtures/benchmark-leaderboards/recorded/`). Each artifact records provenance (`source_urls`, `scrape_date`, `catalog_freeze_date`) in its header.

**Fleet ID aliases (SP-174):** live pi/Cursor scoped-fleet model IDs often differ from leaderboard `model_id` strings. The artifact’s optional `aliases` map sends those fleet IDs to an existing grounded row (never invents scores). `mapPiModelToProfile` sets `capability_source` to `benchmark` when a direct row or alias hits, otherwise `pattern_default`. Operators can also call `getCapabilitySource(modelId)` / `resolveBenchmarkModelId(modelId)`.

**Add a new fleet ID after ingest:**

1. Ensure the canonical model has fixture scores (edit `tests/fixtures/benchmark-leaderboards/*.json` if needed).
2. Run `npm run routing:ingest-benchmarks` (and commit the regenerated `config/benchmark-profiles.json`).
3. Add `"your-fleet-id": "canonical-model_id"` under `aliases` in `config/benchmark-profiles.json` (target must already appear in `models[].model_id`).
4. Re-run ingest anytime — the CLI **preserves** existing `aliases` from the output file. Seed defaults live in `DEFAULT_FLEET_BENCHMARK_ALIASES` when no prior artifact exists.
5. Confirm with `npm run routing:verify-benchmark-profiles` and a mapper unit test that `capability_source === 'benchmark'` for the fleet id.

**Operator refresh command (SP-179 / SP-180):**

| Mode | Command | Network? | When to use |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Fixtures (default)** | `npm run routing:ingest-benchmarks` | No | Local edits, CI, PR smoke |
| **Recorded replay** | `npm run routing:ingest-benchmarks -- --recorded` | No | Replay last successful live snapshots offline |
| **Live + record** | `npm run routing:ingest-benchmarks -- --live` | Yes | Operator refresh; writes `tests/fixtures/benchmark-leaderboards/recorded/` then regenerates profiles |

Optional flags: `--catalog-freeze-date YYYY-MM-DD`, `--scrape-date YYYY-MM-DD`, `--record-dir DIR`, `--live-url BENCHMARK=URL`, `--output PATH`. See `npm run routing:ingest-benchmarks -- --help`.

**Live sources (per benchmark):** each `--live` run resolves independently — live adapter → recorded → checked-in fixtures. One failing source never invents scores or blocks siblings. Logs: `ingest-benchmark-profiles: <id> source=live|recorded|fixture (…)`.

| Benchmark | Default live fetch | Score field | Fallback |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| `swebench_verified` | Native: [SWE-bench `leaderboards.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SWE-bench/swe-bench.github.io/master/data/leaderboards.json) (Verified board) | `resolved` → `score` (0–100) | recorded → fixtures |
| `livecodebench` | Native: [LCB `performances_generation.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiveCodeBench/livecodebench.github.io/main/src/mocks/performances_generation.json) | aggregate `pass@1` | recorded → fixtures |
| `bfcl` | Native: [Gorilla `data_overall.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/gh-pages/data_overall.csv) | `Overall Acc` | recorded → fixtures |
| `terminal_bench` | **No free stable JSON** (tbench.ai is HTML; HF leaderboard is submissions-only; paid Parse API is **not** the default). Pass `--live-url terminal_bench=URL` at a fixture-shaped mirror | `score` (0–100) | recorded → fixtures |

**Terminal-Bench operator mirror schema** (SP-185 / #104):

```json
{
  "benchmark": "terminal_bench",
  "source_url": "https://www.tbench.ai/leaderboard",
  "scrape_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "entries": [{ "model_id": "claude-opus-4-5", "score": 72.5 }]
}
```

Example: `npm run routing:ingest-benchmarks -- --live --live-url terminal_bench=https://example.com/tb-mirror.json`. HTML bodies fail fast; without `--live-url`, TB uses recorded/fixtures. `release:refresh-benchmarks` uses the same `--live` path (fixture fallback on total failure).

**Cadence (release-tied, not calendar):**

| Trigger | When | Behavior |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Pre-tag release gate** | `npm run release:check` → `release:refresh-benchmarks` | Attempt **live** ingest; on failure fall back to fixtures; **fail if** `config/benchmark-profiles.json` or recorded snapshots are dirty — commit on `main`, re-run, then `npm version` / tag |
| **Manual dispatch** | Actions → *Benchmark Profile Refresh* → `workflow_dispatch` (`use_live` default `true`) | Same live-or-fixture path; opens a bot PR when scores change; set `use_live=false` for fixtures-only |
| **PR smoke** | PRs touching fixtures / ingest / artifact / workflow | **Fixtures only** — `npm run routing:verify-benchmark-profiles` (offline, no network) |

There is **no monthly cron**. Refresh runs when you ship so each release packages the latest grounded scores. Tag-triggered Release publish uses `--ignore-scripts` and does not re-fetch (profiles are already frozen in the tag). Offline skip: `SMART_ROUTER_SKIP_LIVE_BENCHMARK_REFRESH=1 npm run release:check`.

**Operator policy:**

1. **PR smoke** — fixture-only verify so PRs never require live network.
2. **Every release** — live with fixture fallback via `release:check`; commit any profile/recorded diffs on `main` before tagging.
3. **Ad-hoc** — Actions dispatch or local `--live` when refreshing between releases.
4. **Manual local updates** — prefer fixtures or `--recorded` for offline work; use `--live` when refreshing from public leaderboard JSON endpoints.

Verify after any regenerate:

```bash
npm run routing:ingest-benchmarks
# or: npm run routing:ingest-benchmarks -- --live
# or: npm run routing:ingest-benchmarks -- --recorded
npm run routing:verify-benchmark-profiles
```

### Releasing

Tag-triggered publish via GitHub Actions (requires `NPMSECRET` repository secret). pi.dev gallery listing syncs automatically from npm (`pi-package` keyword); no separate submit step.

#### PR and pre-release quality gate set

Operators should treat the following as the full gate set before merging routing changes and before tagging a release ([#135](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/135)):

| Gate | Workflow / command | Runs when |
|------|--------------------|-----------|
| Build / typecheck / lint / coverage | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`npm run verify:ci`) | Every PR and push to `main` |
| Eval harness smoke (offline) | `.github/workflows/eval-harness-smoke.yml` | PRs touching `scripts/eval/**`, `tests/eval/**`, **`src/**`**, **`.pi/extensions/smart-router/**`**, `package.json`, or the workflow |
| Calibration verify | `.github/workflows/calibration-verify.yml` | PRs touching calibration config/scripts or calibration-consuming routing code (`src/domain/routing/**`, `src/domain/pipeline/**`, `src/domain/types/**`, `src/cli/**`) |
| Benchmark profile smoke | `.github/workflows/benchmark-profile-refresh.yml` (`routing:verify-benchmark-profiles`) | PRs touching fixtures / ingest / profiles |
| Pre-release functional smoke | `npm run release:check` (Tier 0: calibration `--skip-embed` + benchmark profiles + release-gate assertions) | Operator-run before `npm version` / tag |
| TwinRouterBench full track | `.github/workflows/twinrouterbench-full-nightly.yml` | Nightly / manual only — **never** a required PR check |

Required-check configuration for branch protection is a human-operator repo-settings decision; the workflow path filters above guarantee the jobs **run** on routing code edits regardless of which subset the operator marks required.

**Scope composition:** use `/skill:router-release-operator` for themed release planning (not open-ended backlog cycles). **Patch** = docs + bugfixes only; **minor** = new capability (1–3 related issues under one theme). Budgets and audit rules: [`skills/router-release-operator/references/release-profiles.md`](skills/router-release-operator/references/release-profiles.md).

**Tier 0 functional smoke** (`release:functional-smoke`) runs before tag publish and chains:

1. `routing:verify-calibration --skip-embed` — artifact shape + triage benchmark gates (no ONNX embedding)
2. `routing:verify-benchmark-profiles` — checked-in capability profiles match fixture ingest
3. `assert-release-gates --fixtures tests/eval/fixtures --baseline-version 0.6.0` — eval harness aggregate metrics vs `config/release-gates.json` and semver baseline regression vs `tests/eval/baselines/v0.6.0.json`

The TwinRouterBench CI corpus is **not** part of Tier 0: use `routing:eval-harness:corpus-smoke` / `routing:assert-release-gates:corpus-report` for offline public-track soft-feed ([#95](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-smart-router/issues/95)). Absolute thresholds in `config/release-gates.json` stay fixture-backed until operators approve a change.

`release:check` runs the full pre-release path: **live benchmark profile refresh** (fixture fallback; dirty-tree fail), then `verify:ci`, consumer pack verify, then Tier 0 functional smoke.

**Baseline re-capture (post-tag):** after shipping a new semver (e.g. v0.7.0), freeze harness metrics for the next regression reference:

```bash
# Capture aggregate metrics from current fixtures (writes tests/eval/baselines/v0.7.0.json)
npm run routing:capture-baseline -- --version 0.7.0

# Point release gates at the new reference (config/release-gates.json + release:functional-smoke --baseline-version)
```

Commit the new baseline JSON and update `baseline_regression.reference_version` in `config/release-gates.json` plus the `--baseline-version` flag in `release:functional-smoke`. Re-run `npm run release:check` before tagging the next release.

1. `npm run release:check` (live benchmark refresh → CI parity + consumer pack + Tier 0 functional smoke)
   - If refresh rewrites profiles/recorded snapshots, **commit them on `main`** and re-run until clean
2. `npm version 0.1.1` (creates commit + `v0.1.1` tag)
3. `git push && git push --tags`
4. Actions → **Release** runs pack smoke, consumer pack verify, Tier 0 functional smoke, `npm publish`, and creates a GitHub Release

Re-publish a failed release: Actions → Release → Run workflow with existing tag (e.g. `v0.1.1`).

Dry-run tarball contents locally:

```bash
npm run release:check
npm pack --dry-run
```

**Post-publish smoke (manual, macOS):** CI does not run `pi install`. After publish (use the version just published; remove any path-package clone entry first if dogfooding):

```bash
pi remove ../../Documents/github/pi-smart-router   # if path dogfood was installed
pi install npm:pi-smart-router@<published-version>
pi --list-models | grep smart-router
# in pi: /model smart-router/auto, /smart-router status
```

Confirm https://pi.dev/packages/pi-smart-router shows the new version (may lag npm by a few minutes).

### Test suite

## Develop with pi-spine (agent models)

This repo is developed with [pi-spine](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-spine) batches. Agent model pins live in [`.spine/spine-config.json`](.spine/spine-config.json) under `agents.*`. Use **canonical** `provider/model` ids from `pi --list-models` (not TUI labels like `glm-5.3 [zai]`). Run `spine doctor` before real-pi batches.

Named profiles (`agents.profiles` + `agents.activeProfile`) and `agents.escalatePolicy` are configured in spine-config ([pi-spine#216](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-spine/issues/216) / SP-664). Live stack resolves from `activeProfile` over the base `agents` block. Hybrid cost/quality recipes are documented upstream in [pi-spine#210](https://github.com/beettlle/pi-spine/issues/210).

**Sale window (through 2026-09-09 UTC+8):** plan review and supervisor use `zai/glm-5.3-flash` (Z.AI 50% promo). After the promo, revert plan to `google/gemini-flash-latest` and supervisor to `google/gemini-flash-lite-latest` if desired.

### Default profile (`activeProfile: "default"`)

| Role | Model | Thinking |
|------|--------|----------|
| Worker | `kimi-coding/k3` | `high` |
| Plan review | `zai/glm-5.3-flash` | `low` |
| Code review | `kimi-coding/kimi-for-coding` | `high` |
| Final review | `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | `high` |
| Supervisor | `zai/glm-5.3-flash` | `off` |

### When to escalate (hard packets / sticky failures)

Escalate when:

- The same SP fails final or code review **2+** times with substantive `REVISE` (not broad `testCommand` / lane noise)
- The worker stalls or oscillates on multi-file design
- The packet needs deeper reasoning than the default stack delivered

### Tier 1 — budget escalate

Switches the worker to `zai/glm-5.3` (same list price as 5.2; plan/supervisor stay on sale Flash).

```bash
spine settings set agents.activeProfile budget
spine batch retry <SP-ID>
# restore:
spine settings set agents.activeProfile default
```

### Tier 2 — hard escalate

| Role | Model | Thinking |
|------|--------|----------|
| Worker | `kimi-coding/k3` | `high` |
| Plan | `kimi-coding/kimi-for-coding` | `medium` |
| Code | `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | `high` |
| Final | `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | `high` |

`escalatePolicy.toProfile` is `hard`. Switch explicitly when a packet is sticky:

```bash
spine settings set agents.activeProfile hard
spine doctor
spine batch retry <SP-ID>
# restore:
spine settings set agents.activeProfile default
```
